        "first_5_page_texts": "ANNUAL REPORT2 0 2 3Dear Shareholders:\nLast year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon\u2019s future. Today, I have even more.\nThe reasons are many, but start with the progress we\u2019ve made in our financial results and customer\nexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\nIn 2023, Amazon\u2019s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (\u201cY oY\u201d) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North\nAmerica revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from\n$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B.\nFurther, Amazon\u2019s operating income and Free Cash Flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) dramatically improved. Operating\nincome in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operating\nmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8B\nin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\nWhile we\u2019ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we\u2019re most pleased about is the\ncontinued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price,\nand convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products\navailable, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon\n(e.g. Coach, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, and Urban Decay).\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are\ncareful about how much they\u2019re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime\nBig Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This\nwas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,\nthat became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions of\ndeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon\ndelivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next\nday, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is the\ncombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to\nstore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increased\nthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers this\nfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in\nvarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023).\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In\n2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit Y oY . Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to invest\nin speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (\u201cASPs\u201d). More\nselection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we\u2019re not done lowering our cost to serve. We\u2019ve challenged every\nclosely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where\nwe believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment\narchitecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there\u2019s\nmore upside for us.\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our\nemerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue toexpand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest\ninternational Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies will\ncontinue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\nAlongside our Stores business, Amazon\u2019s Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% Y oY from\n$38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We\u2019ve added Sponsored TV to this\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming\nTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we\u2019ve expanded\nour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands can\nreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies and\nshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips\n(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),\nS3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store them\nin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longer\ncommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,\nand should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimization\nattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, and\nmigrations growing again.\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memory\nbandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,\nwhich will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and three\ntimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,\nnow offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming\n(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German region\nin Berlin). In Generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easier\nfor developers to build new Foundation Models (\u201cFMs\u201d). We invented and delivered a new service (Amazon\nBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched the\nmost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we\u2019re\nseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we\u2019re approaching GenAI and why we\nbelieve we\u2019ll be successful later in the letter.)\nWe\u2019re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This\nconfidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night\nFootball, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers\u2019 engagement\nwith this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, as\nwell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising in\nPrime Video.\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two\nend-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems\u2014\nrare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide\nbroadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don\u2019t have it today (as well as governments\nand enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenue\nopportunity for Amazon. We\u2019re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We\u2019ve still got a\nlong way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I\u2019m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of\ncustomers. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, and reimaginationacross Amazon. Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one\nof our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers\u2019 lives better and easier, and there is\nconsiderable upside in each of the businesses in which we\u2019re investing.\n===\nIn my annual letter over the last three years, I\u2019ve tried to give shareholders more insight into how we\u2019re\nthinking about the company, the businesses we\u2019re pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes us\ntick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint mission\nto make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve\n(consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we\u2019re not just customer\nobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, and\noperating like the world\u2019s biggest start-up.\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company.\nWe characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what\u2019s\nwrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect.\nThis doesn\u2019t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkering\nand iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about using\nhigh-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the right\ntools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services . Think of them as discrete, foundational\nbuilding blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here\u2019s how we\ndescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\n\u201cPrimitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They\u2019re indivisible\n(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They\u2019re meant to be used\ntogether rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we\u2019ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. We\nwon\u2019t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we\u2019ll optimize for\ndeveloper freedom and innovation.\u201d\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they\u2019re\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we\u2019ve\ninnovated quickly.\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed . Let me give you two counter examples that\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazon\nwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in our\nwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lower\nprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search and\nproduct detail pages. We\u2019d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, item\nmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn\u2019t have those\ncomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned\nthis the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early\n2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon\u2019s ecommerce components as the backbone of\nits website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver those\ncomponents as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d). This decoupling\nwas far more difficult than anticipated because we\u2019d built so many dependencies between these services as\nAmazon grew so quickly the first few years.\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called \u201cNPI.\u201d Any\nnew initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where each\nteam would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrained\nwhat we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring theseecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our\nbuilders to use each other\u2019s services without any coordination tax.\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure\ntechnology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers to\nbuild anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiences\nconvinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybody\nsaw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobs\nsimultaneously. As a result, they often didn\u2019t do any one job that well.\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly\nflexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service\n(\u201cS3\u201d) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability and\navailability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launched\nS3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered,\nwhy just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (\u201cEC2\u201d) in August 2006 and\nAmazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services that\nwould allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and without\nhaving to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these building\nblocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders\u2019 disposal\u2014meaningfully more than any other provider),\nwhole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.),\nindustries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox,\nParamount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several other\nU.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon\u2019s own consumer\nbusinesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV),\nPrime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with which\nAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders\u2019 ability to innovate .\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?\nPursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to\ncombine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you\u2019re trying to solve .\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon\u2019s early years, we built core capabilities\naround warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers.\nAs we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these same\nlogistics capabilities. Because we\u2019d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduce\nFulfillment by Amazon (\u201cFBA \u201d) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon\u2019s Fulfillment Network to store\nitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products being\navailable for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about\n70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchants\nbegan to operate their own direct-to-consumer (\u201cDTC\u201d) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillment\ncapabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion on\ntheir own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information with\nAmazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime members\ncan check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds on\nBuy with Prime items\u2014increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we\u2019ve had to\ndevelop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fast\ndelivery times. We\u2019ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs,\nand then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don\u2019t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centers\nto store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we\u2019ve built a set of lower-cost,\nupstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and ship\nfunctions). Having these two pools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we\u2019ll\nrun out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically replenishing from these upstream"

For this, we are forever \ngrateful.\nWe are also immensely proud of the Huawei team: \nWe\u2019ve managed to keep our heads above the water \nbecause we fought together, united as one. This is Plum blossoms tend to grow sweeter \nfrom a harsh winter \u2019s freeze. Today, \nHuawei is like a plum blossom. While \nit\u2019s true that we have considerable \npressure ahead of us, we have what \nit takes to come out the other end \u2013 \nwith opportunities to grow, a resilient \nbusiness portfolio, a unique competitive \nedge, the enduring trust of our customers \nand partners, and the courage to invest \nheavily in R&D.

This is the only way we can \nlay a solid foundation for Huawei\u2019s future.\nHelping industries go digital, \nintelligent, and green to unlock new \ngrowth opportunities\nCountries around the world have turned to developing \ntheir digital economy as a key counterweight against \neconomic downturn. By 2027, a growing digital \neconomy will open up trillion-dollar addressable \nmarkets for our company. Naturally, countries at \ndifferent stages of development will choose different \npaths as they build up their digital economy, just as \ndifferent industries and organizations will choose the \npath that works best for their digital journey. In some \ncases, opting for the most advanced technology is not \nnecessarily the best solution.\nAt Huawei, we put customers\u2019 needs front and center, \nproviding them with the right technology for the \nright scenario, at the right time and with the right \nmodel, following the shortest route to market. For \nthis purpose, we have established multiple integrated \nteams for specific industries, including finance, mining, \ngovernment public services, transportation (airports, \nrails, roads, waterway, and ports), and electric power. \nWe aim to become the preferred partner for industries \nas they go digital, intelligent, and green \u2013 and in \ndoing so, we can pave the way for our own long-term \ngrowth, too.\nOptimizing our business portfolio to \nenhance resilience\nWe continue to optimize our business portfolio, \nwhich now covers a mix of ICT infrastructure, smart \ndevices, Huawei Cloud, digital power, and intelligent \nautomotive solutions, backed by technological support platforms like our 2012 Laboratories and HiSilicon. \nThis portfolio includes a mix of our well-established \nbusiness domains and a handful of more pioneering \ndomains. Some are developing stably while others \nare growing rapidly. Some rely on advanced process \ntechnology and others don\u2019t. Some are hardware-\ncentric while others are software-centric. Together, \nthey constitute a resilient business portfolio in terms \nof both structure and potential, forming a solid basis \nfor Huawei\u2019s sustainable survival and development.\nStrengthening synergy between \nchips, software, hardware, devices, \nnetworks, and clouds to hone our \nunique competitive edge\nThrough years of concerted effort, we have built \nrelatively strong competitiveness in our business \ndomains, and we have good reason to believe \nwe\u2019ll maintain this edge for the foreseeable future. \nBut given our inability to access advanced process \ntechnology, we need to keep exploring ways to \nfurther enhance the long-term competitiveness of \nour products and services.\nHuawei has the most comprehensive set of \ntechnologies in ICT, and this is our unique advantage. \nMoving forward, we will step up integrated innovation \nacross tech domains \u2013 namely chips, software, \nhardware, devices, networks, and clouds \u2013 to ensure \nevery bit of data can be collected, transmitted, \nprocessed, and presented in an optimal way. \nDelivering the simplest possible architecture, highest \npossible quality, lowest possible costs, and a superior \nexperience is our goal.\nWe are working hard to optimize network \nperformance, energy consumption, cloud resource \nutilization, cloud application performance, O&M \nefficiency, and service capabilities. And we will \ncontinue to optimize user experience for devices and \nintelligent vehicles. In these ways and more, we are \ncreating new value for our customers.

Last year, I was \nproud to announce McDonald\u2019s first ever Chief \nCustomer Officer\u2014Manu Steijaert\u2014to lead the \nnewly created Customer Experience T eam, which \nwill ensure we stay focused on creating frictionless \nexperiences that are seamless and memorable.  \nManu\u2019s appointment was complemented by \nadditional leadership moves, including Paul Pomroy \nas Corporate Senior Vice President, International \nOperated Markets; and Morgan Flatley as Global  \nChief Marketing Officer. We were also excited to \nappoint Desiree Ralls-Morrison as our new General \nCounsel and Corporate Secretary.  \nI am honored to surround myself with a leadership \nteam that elevates and expands our collective \nthinking, and delivers results that propel our  \nbrand forward.  Our focus on the M-C-Ds has driven broad-based  \ngrowth in 2021. Our digital engine continues to  \nmake the customer experience more seamless  \nand fuels growth in the process. In our top six \nmarkets, more than a quarter of Systemwide  \nsales, or $18 billion, came from digital channels  \nin 2021\u2014a 60% increase over 2020. Three of  \nour largest markets  \u2014the U.S., Germany and  \nCanada\u2014all launched loyalty programs in 2021.  \nWith loyalty programs now in more than 40 markets, \nMyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards has exceeded expectations \nin terms of enrollment and participation. After \njust six months in the U.S., there are more than 30 \nmillion loyalty members enrolled and more than \n21 million active members earning rewards. We \nalso announced new long-term global strategic \npartnerships to support McDelivery.  \nWhile we expect that 2022 will be a year of  \ncontinued progress, we also anticipate that many  \nof the challenges we experienced in 2021 will endure. \nFocusing on our foundational operations, expanding \nour growing digital advantages, and continuing to \nput the health and safety of our customers and crew \nfirst will remain critical to executing on Accelerating \nthe Arches.  These accomplishments highlight the \npower of our System when we come together across \nfunctions and geographies, and quickly follow our \ncustomers\u2019 lead. \nChris Kempczinski \nPresident and CEO \nMcDonald\u2019s CorporationA stronger Brand than ever before in person after so long, we asked ourselves, as we \nhave done throughout our history, how we ensure \nthe Brand stays relevant. The answer lies in the \nfounding principles of our model: building a  \nbusiness representative of our customers and \ncommunities, where equity of opportunity is \ncentral to our business. That\u2019s why, late last year, \nwe announced a new Franchisee recruitment \ninitiative to increase the number of Franchisees \nfrom all backgrounds, including historically \nunderrepresented groups, in McDonald\u2019s U.S. and  \nall McDonald\u2019s International Operated Markets.  \nThis includes a $250 million commitment in the U.S. \nover five years to provide alternatives to traditional \nfinancing to help candidates join the McDonald\u2019s \nSystem. During a period of record performance, we \nmust challenge ourselves\u2014even more\u2014to invest in \nthe future. We owe that to our communities\u2014and to \nthe people who make up the McDonald\u2019s System.\nThe enduring strength of McDonald\u2019s Brand gives  \nus confidence that our strategy will continue to \ndeliver sustained, long-term profitable growth  \nfor our System and shareholders. The McDonald\u2019s \nBoard of Directors has provided counsel and an \nunwavering dedication to ensure that in pursuit \nof this objective, we continue to represent all \nstakeholders. I want to thank them, our System,  \nour shareholders, and our customers for their \ncontinued support.  \nAdditionally, I would like to thank the McDonald\u2019s \nBoard of Directors who have provided counsel  \nand an unwavering dedication to represent  \nall stakeholders.\nAnd most importantly, on behalf of the McDonald\u2019s \nSystem, I extend our heartfelt gratitude to our crew. Ray Kroc built McDonald\u2019s as the most independent \nand interdependent Brand on the planet. We see  \nthe power and collaborative spirit of our Brand  \nevery single day\u2014and together, as a System, we  \nwill continue to bring Ray\u2019s vision for collaboration  \nto life, while providing customers the food they \ncrave, experiences they treasure, and the Brand \nthey love. It\u2019s this commitment that will  accelerate \nthe arches  while helping us feed and foster \ncommunities, everywhere. \nEarlier in April and for the first time in four years, \nwe came together as a System at our Worldwide \nConvention.

        "first_5_page_texts": "Annual ReportWe Are Stronger Than EverDear  \nShareholders, \nthe Global  \nMcFamily and \nour Customers,\nI opened last year\u2019s letter  by stating that \nthere was never a better time to be part of \nBrand McDonald\u2019s. Thanks to the System\u2019s \nhard work, that remains true today.\nDespite facing external pressures in markets \naround the globe in 2022, we continue to \nbuild strong momentum in the business \n\u2013 a true testament to the ingenuity of our \npeople, the resilience of our supply chain \nand the dedication of local franchisees and \nrestaurant teams serving our customers.\nIt was incredibly energizing to bring our \nSystem together last April for our first \nWorldwide Convention since the start of  \nthe pandemic. On full display was what I  \nlove most about McDonald\u2019s \u2013 our restless \nenergy and ambition. We\u2019re never satisfied, \nwhich is why McDonald\u2019s continues to be \none of the world\u2019s leading corporations after \nalmost 70 years. As Ray Kroc used to say, \n\u201cyou\u2019re either green and growing or you\u2019re \nripe and rotting.\u201d In other words, we\u2019re only \ngoing to stay relevant to customers if we\u2019re \nconsistently raising the bar.\nOur Brand is more relevant than ever before, \nbut we still have so much more we can do. \nI\u2019m proud that as we operate from a position \nof strength, we are all pushing ourselves  \nAnnual Letter to Shareholderspopular, we also launched our largest global  \ncampaign ever for the FIFA World Cup,  \u201cWanna  \ngo to McDonald\u2019s?\u201d\nWe are also capitalizing on the strength of the  \n\u2018billion-dollar brand equities\u2019 in our Core  (\u201cC\u201d)   \nmenu \u2013 10 in total \u2013 and growing market share  \nin chicken and beef.  \nMoreover, Digital, Delivery and Drive Thru  (3-\u201cDs\u201d) \ncontinue to demonstrate huge growth potential.  \nWe remain focused on meeting customers where  \nthey are and providing more personalized \nexperiences. We now have almost 50 million  \nactive loyalty users in our top six markets.\nto make the right moves to meet the needs of our \ncommunities and ensure enduring, profitable growth \nfor all stakeholders.\nGrowing market share through \ncustomer centricity  \nThe System\u2019s alignment around our Accelerating the \nArches  growth strategy, which we put in place at the \nstart of the pandemic, has put us in an advantageous \nposition. We are growing market share in most of our \nmarkets; the Brand is more relevant to customers \nand stakeholders than it has been in years; and, since \n2020, we\u2019ve achieved an increase in Systemwide \nsales 1  of nearly $20 billion.  \nThat momentum continued through 2022, as global \ncomparable sales grew by almost 11% \u2013 and global \nguest counts grew by 5%. Our success is a direct \nresult of our continued focus on our M, C, D  \ngrowth pillars:\nWe continue to elevate our Marketing (\u201cM\u201d) through \ncreative excellence and by driving programs with \ncultural relevance that can be scaled across markets. \nNot only do our Famous Orders remain hugelyAccelerating the \nArches has put us in an \nadvantageous position\nEarning the right to meet customer \nneeds in new ways  \nIt\u2019s clear that our business plan is working. However, \nas we have throughout our history, we continue  \nto push ourselves to keep our Brand relevant for \nfuture generations. \nWe asked ourselves two questions: Is there \nanything we should add to Accelerating the Arches ? \nAnd is there anything that could get in the way of its \ncontinued success?  \nAnnual Letter to Shareholders1 Consists of both Company and franchised sales\nThe answer to these two questions led us to evolve \nour Accelerating the Arches  strategy to set up a \nstrong foundation for future growth. We\u2019ll continue \nto double down on our M, C, D growth pillars, while \naccelerating the pace of new restaurant openings \nwhere there is increased customer demand, alongside \na diverse base of franchisees to run them. Additionally, \nwe\u2019re implementing Accelerating the Organization to \nmodernize the way we work as a company so that \nwe\u2019re faster, more innovative and more efficient.\nT o drive these critical elements of our evolved \nstrategy, we have created new leadership roles on  \nour global Senior Leadership T eam and appointed \nvalues-based leaders into new roles.  \nMorgan Flatley has been promoted to Executive \nVice President, Global Chief Marketing Officer and \nNew Business Ventures, where she will continue to \noversee our award-winning marketing efforts and \nexpand her scope to lead new business ventures with \nopportunities that extend the reach of the Brand in \nnew ways.  \nSkye Anderson has been elevated to President,  \nGlobal Business Services (GBS). Skye will oversee GBS,  \na new business unit of McDonald\u2019s that will make the \norganization more efficient, make it easier for teams \nto collaborate and free up time for our markets to \nfocus on driving growth in the business.   \nThese appointments were complemented by \nadditional leadership moves: Kevin Ozan to Senior \nExecutive Vice President, Strategic Initiatives; Ian Borden to Executive Vice President, Chief \nFinancial Officer; Marion Gross to Executive Vice \nPresident, Global Chief Supply Chain Officer; and Jo \nSempels to President, International Developmental \nLicensed Markets. \nIn addition to these moves, we were delighted \nfor Jill McDonald to rejoin McDonald\u2019s last year \nas President, International Operated Markets. \nAnd we also welcomed Brian Rice as our new \nExecutive Vice President, Global Chief Information \nOfficer, and Jon Banner as our new Executive Vice \nPresident, Global Chief Impact Officer.\nI am proud to work closely with such a dynamic \nteam that collectively acts as a phenomenal \nsteward of the Brand. Every single leader embodies \nour values and plays a crucial role in driving efforts \nthat propel our growth.   \nTaking meaningful action to advance  \nequity of opportunity  \nBeyond meeting the changing needs of our \ncustomers, Accelerating the Arches  is guiding  \nour efforts to feed and foster communities and \nmake the Golden Arches shine for more people.  \nAs a first job for thousands and a first opportunity \nfor many entrepreneurs to run their own \nbusinesses, we feel a special responsibility to  \noffer even more meaningful opportunities.  \nMeeting customers \nwhere they are\nAnnual Letter to Shareholderschanges. And it\u2019s more important than ever that  \nwe raise our ambition to meet tomorrow\u2019s \nchallenges and make the important decisions  \nthat go with them.\nAs we closed out 2022 and hit the ground running \nin 2023, we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to \nlook forward to \u2013 not just in the year ahead, but in \nthis next great chapter at McDonald\u2019s. Throughout \nthis chapter and beyond, I am confident that we will \ncontinue to deliver sustained, long-term, profitable \ngrowth for our System and shareholders.\nThank you to our shareholders and valued \ncustomers for your continued support; thank you to \nour Board of Directors for their ongoing guidance \nand support; and thank you to the McDonald\u2019s \nSystem for making this another year of which I am \nimmensely proud. In the last year, this included advancing education \nand skill development opportunities. We awarded \nmore than $20 million in tuition assistance, and \naccess to education for more than 10,000 employees \nthrough our Archways to Opportunity  program. \nAdditionally, we launched support for 40 non-\nprofits that provide pre-employment support and \nskills development primarily to Black and Latinx \ncommunities through the new Chicago Community \nImpact Grants  program.\nKey to building a talent pipeline of future leaders \nand expanding opportunity is fostering a culture of \ninclusivity. In 2022, as part of our Allyship through \nAccountability  program, we introduced expectations \nthat hold all Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents \nand Managing Directors accountable for engaging in \ninclusive behaviors that support talent development \nand build a strong, diverse succession pipeline \u2013 \nwith their performance against these expectations \ndirectly contributing to their compensation.\nMoreover, we\u2019ve taken additional steps to champion \nentrepreneurship and generational wealth across \nour System. This is of particular importance as we \nseek to increase our recruitment of first-time owners \nfrom underrepresented groups. Building on our 2021 \ncommitment of $250 million to further diversify our \nfranchisee base, we announced additional steps to \nbring clarity, transparency and consistency to our \nfranchising processes.  \nThese actions advance our efforts to keep equity  \nof opportunity central to our business, while \nensuring that our franchisee base better reflects  \nthe communities we serve.\nRaising the bar for the future\nDuring one of McDonald\u2019s first Worldwide \nConventions, Ray Kroc said: \u201cWe are living in a rapidly \nchanging world, so McDonald\u2019s will change with it.\u201d \nMcDonald\u2019s has a deep legacy of holding ourselves \nto the highest standards as the world around usChris Kempczinski \nPresident and CEO \nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation\nFostering a  \nculture of care  \nand opportunity\nAnnual Letter to Shareholders"

We delivered our\u00a0best-\never net profit despite considerable \nglobal headwinds. We continued to \nachieve good progress in executing on \nour strategy, and made significant \nadvancements in our commitment to \nour sustainability agenda. Our \norganisational capabilities were further \nenhanced. We stepped up investments in \ntechnology and our people which yielded \npositive outcomes, while wholeheartedly \nsupporting the communities we serve. \nOCBC remains fully committed to deliver \nexcellence and sustainable value for all \nour stakeholders.\nWith much of the world adapting to \nCovid, 2022 had initially started on a \npositive footing. Developed countries \nwere gradually reopening, providing \nmomentum for a global economic recovery. \nHowever, the start of the Russia-Ukraine \ncrisis in February 2022 precipitated a \nspike in commodity and energy prices, \ndisrupted supply chains and heightened \nvolatilities in financial markets. Inflation \nturned out to be higher and more persistent \nthan the initial expectations of many \ncentral banks. Monetary policies were \ntightened through a series of rapid \ninterest rates hikes. In Greater China, \nongoing pandemic-related restrictions \nduring the year contributed to \na\u00a0slowdown in economic activities. \nThe\u00a0combination of these conditions \ncurtailed global growth in 2022. Despite these headwinds, OCBC delivered \na record operating performance in 2022. \nAccordingly, we are pleased to raise our \n2022 dividend to 68 cents, up 28% from \nthe previous year.\nRecord Financial Performance\nWe achieved record high Group net profit, \nimproved return on equity, better efficiency \nratios and increased shareholder returns, \nwhilst we maintained our strong capital \nposition.

This Report presents the Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell (pages 237-307), the Parent Company Financial Statements of Shell (pages 340-349) and the Financial Statements of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust  (pages \n352-356 ). Except for these Financial Statements, the numbers presented \nthroughout this Report may not sum precisely to the totals provided and\u00a0percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures due to\u00a0rounding.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell plc and its subsidiaries \ncontained in this Report have been prepared in accordance with \ninternational accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of\u00a0the UK Companies Act 2006 (the \"Act\"), and therefore in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. As applied to Shell, there are no material differences from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. IFRS as defined above includes interpretations issued  by the IFRS Interpretations \nCommittee. Financial reporting terms used in this Report are in accordance with IFRS. \nThis Report contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such \nas\u00a0cash capital expenditure . We are unable to provide a reconciliation \nof\u00a0these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be\u00a0reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc\u2019s consolidated financial statements.  \nThe entities in which Shell plc directly or indirectly owns investments are\u00a0separate legal entities. In addition to the term \"Shell\", in this Report \"Shell Group\", \"Group\", \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries \", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \n\"Shell companies\" refer to those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. \"Joint ventures\" and\u00a0\"joint operations\" are collectively referred to as \"joint arrangements\". Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as \"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. Shell subsidiaries\u2019 data include their interests in joint operations. \nAs used in this Report, \"Accountable\" is intended to mean: required or \nexpected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, \nand\u00a0Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and\u00a0policies.Shell\u2019s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a 10-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets \nover the next 10 years. However, Shell\u2019s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society \nmoves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell\u2019s operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050 as of today, there would significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. \nShell\u2019s \"Net Carbon Intensity\"  referred to in this Report include Shell\u2019s \ncarbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our \nsuppliers\u2019 carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production, and our customers\u2019 carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term\u00a0\"N et Carbon Intensity\"  is for convenience only and not intended \nto\u00a0suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. \nExcept where indicated, the figures shown in the tables in this Report are in respect of subsidiaries only, without deduction of any non-controlling interest. However, the term \"Shell share\" is used for convenience to refer to the volumes of hydrocarbons that are produced, processed or sold through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. All of a subsidiary\u2019s production, processing or sales volumes (including the share of joint operations) are included in the Shell share, even if Shell owns less than 100% of the subsidiary. In the case of joint ventures and associates, however, Shell-share figures are limited only to Shell\u2019s entitlement. In all\u00a0cases, royalty payments in kind are deducted from the Shell share.  \nExcept where indicated, the figures shown in this Report are stated in US\u00a0dollars. As used herein all references to \"dollars\" or \"$\" are to the US\u00a0currency. \nThis Report contains forward-looking statements  concerning the financial \ncondition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements \nother than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management\u2019s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management\u2019s expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a\u00a0number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell\u2019s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. Also see \"Risk factors\" on pages 15-26 for \nadditional risks and further discussion. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments.

Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, \nand\u00a0Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and\u00a0policies.Shell\u2019s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a 10-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets \nover the next 10 years. However, Shell\u2019s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society \nmoves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell\u2019s operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050 as of today, there would significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. \nShell\u2019s \"Net Carbon Intensity\"  referred to in this Report include Shell\u2019s \ncarbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our \nsuppliers\u2019 carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production, and our customers\u2019 carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term\u00a0\"N et Carbon Intensity\"  is for convenience only and not intended \nto\u00a0suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. \nExcept where indicated, the figures shown in the tables in this Report are in respect of subsidiaries only, without deduction of any non-controlling interest. However, the term \"Shell share\" is used for convenience to refer to the volumes of hydrocarbons that are produced, processed or sold through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. All of a subsidiary\u2019s production, processing or sales volumes (including the share of joint operations) are included in the Shell share, even if Shell owns less than 100% of the subsidiary. In the case of joint ventures and associates, however, Shell-share figures are limited only to Shell\u2019s entitlement. In all\u00a0cases, royalty payments in kind are deducted from the Shell share.  \nExcept where indicated, the figures shown in this Report are stated in US\u00a0dollars. As used herein all references to \"dollars\" or \"$\" are to the US\u00a0currency. \nThis Report contains forward-looking statements  concerning the financial \ncondition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements \nother than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management\u2019s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management\u2019s expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a\u00a0number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell\u2019s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. Also see \"Risk factors\" on pages 15-26 for \nadditional risks and further discussion. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments.

Mackenzie \nChairMy geologist's mind has always been intrigued by what lies beneath \nour\u00a0feet, including the natural energy resources that have propelled the\u00a0world's economic progress for so long. But with the  urgent  need \nto\u00a0tackle climate change, I am just as fascinated by the technologies that will help the world deliver cleaner power and fuel the future, as\u00a0well as\u00a0significantly cut carbon emissions.\nAlong with great challenges, the energy transition offers tremendous \nopportunities to those eager to play their part. For well over a century, Shell has pioneered ways of providing energy to people. We are a\u00a0leader in deep-water oil production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) \nand\u00a0biofuels, and we aim to become one of the largest p roviders \nof\u00a0charging for electric vehicles. \nWe aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive \nstrengths and see strong customer demand and clear support from governments. Our strategy is to create value for our shareholders, customers and wider society as we reduce our emissions and fulfil our\u00a0purpose to provide more and cleaner energy solutions.\nFor Shell, 2023 was a pivotal year in our drive to achieve more value \nwith less emissions. It was the first year under our new Chief Executive Officer, Wael Sawan, who stressed the importance of enhancing our returns to\u00a0shareholders, while staying firm on our target to become a \nnet-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We did exactly that by maintaining a very healthy balance sheet, increasing our dividends and\u00a0continuing to buy back shares, all while investing capital to reduce\u00a0our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and Scope 3 emissions related\u00a0to\u00a0the use of the oil products we sell.\nPeople everywhere need a secure, sustainable and affordable energy \nsupply. Shell can help to enable a balanced energy transition by keeping the world moving with oil and gas, while delivering the low-carbon alternatives our customers need to decarbonise. To this end, we\u00a0have made it clear that we plan to expand our LNG business and develop new low-carbon products and technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). \nI saw this when I visited Qatar's North Field expansion project in \nJanuary 2024. This project will support the delivery of much-needed supplies of natural gas around the world and I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about how we are developing a CCS project\u00a0there. I also visited Oman and saw how we are moving \nforward\u00a0with a\u00a0hydrogen project, enabled by CCS. \nMore value, less emissions\nShell's 2023 earnings were strong and we reduced our total combined Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 31% [A] compared with 2016 levels. This positions us well as we continue \nto implement our strategy , guided by the free cash flow *, investment and \ncost reduction targets set in 2023. We will continue to create value for shareholders and lower emissions .\n[A] Reduc ed from 83 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2016 to 57 million \ntonnes CO2e in 2023\n* Non-GAAP measure (see page 365).Strategic Report\nChair's message\n2 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n 2\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2023"

References to any specific investments of an SB Fund, to the extent included therein, are presented to illustrate the relevant SB Fund Manager\u2019s investment process and operating philosophy only and should not be construed as a recommendation of any particular investment or security. The performance of individual investments of an SB Fund may vary, and the performance of the selected transactions is not necessarily indicative of the performance of all of the applicable prior investments. The specific investments identified and described in this Annual Report do not represent all of the investments made by the relevant SB Fund Manager, and no assumption should be made that investments identified and discussed therein were or will be profitable.\n The performance of an SB Fund in this Annual Report is based on unrealized valuations of portfolio investments. Valuations of unr ealized investments are based on assumptions and factors (including, for example, as of the date of the valuation, average multiples of \ncomparable companies, and other considerations) that the relevant SB Fund Manager believes are reasonable under the circumstances relating to each particular investment. However, there can be no assurance that unrealized investments will be realized at the valuations indicated in this Annual Report or used to calculate the returns contained therein, and transaction costs connected with such realizations remain unknown and, therefore, are not factored into such calculations. Estimates of unrealized value are subject to numerous variables that change over time. The actual realized returns on the relevant SB Fund\u2019s unrealized investments will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ from the assumptions and circumstances on which the relevant SB Fund Manager\u2019s valuations are based.\n Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The performance of an SB Fund or any futur e fund managed by an SB Fund Manager may be materially lower than the performance information presented in this Annual Report. There can be no assurance that \neach SB Fund or any future fund managed by the relevant SB Fund Manager will achieve comparable results as those presented therein.\n The actual realized retur n on unrealized investments by an SB Fund may differ materially from the performance information indicated in this Annual Report. No assumption should be made that investments identified and discussed in this Annual Report were or will be \nprofitable, or that investments made in the future will be comparable in quality or performance to the investments described therein.\n Third-party logos and vendor information included in this Annual Report are provided for illustrative purposes only. Inclusion of such logos does not imply affiliation with or endorsement by such firms or businesses.

In everything we do, we aim to drive the Information Revolution and build a more connected, empowered, and joyful world.

They act \nwith one mind to achieve their ideals, braving all dangers to usher in a new era amid upheaval. SBG draws inspiration from one such group\u2014the Kaientai, an enterprising shipping company founded in 1865 by the visionary Sakamoto Ryoma. Supplied with the best intelligence and possessing abundant knowledge and wisdom, the Kaientai and its founder rejected age-worn feudalistic values in favor of free thinking and bold action. In this way, they led a revolution that resulted in the modernization of Japan. Our corporate logo derives from the Kaientai\u2019s flag. It represents our admiration for, and belief in, the Kaientai\u2019s single-minded pursuit of their vision, which imagined a Japan 100 years in the future.\n SBG is a fleet of similar visionaries. Our vessels \nfly the banner of the 21st-century Kaientai, symbolizing our own single-minded pursuit of a vision: Information Revolution\u2014Happiness for everyone.A two-line design\u2014the banner of the Information Revolution that SBG hoists as we sail \ntoward a new dawn\nKaientai banner SoftBank Brand Symbol\n SoftBank Group Report 2023\n3\nFinancial Section Corporate Information Foundation for Our Growth Growth Assets Message from Our CEO Table of Contents Who We Are\nMessage from Our CFO"
