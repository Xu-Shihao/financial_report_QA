We delivered record operating income of  \\nmore than $10 billion. And Franchisee cash flows hit  \\nall-time highs in most of our top markets, including  \\nthe U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and Japan.  \\nMcDonald’s and our Franchisees are not only  \\nwell positioned to withstand the ongoing global  \\npressures, but we are set up for the long-term.  \\nWhen times are at their darkest, again and again, \\nwe see the Golden Arches shine their brightest. And \\nwhile what happens next in Ukraine is unclear, we will \\ncontinue to support our McFamily and communities \\nin Ukraine for as long as is needed.Annual Letter to Shareholders\\nWhen times are \\nat their darkest, \\nagain and again, \\nwe see the Golden \\nArches shine their \\nbrightest. Standards to strengthen our commitment \\nto fostering safe, respectful and inclusive \\nworkplaces; our Mutual Commitment to Diversity, \\nEquity and Inclusion alongside our suppliers to \\nsupport diverse-owned businesses; reaching \\nglobal gender pay parity; and raising wages at U.S. \\ncompany-owned restaurants. Supporting restaurant teams  \\nthrough a culture of care \\n2021 was a reminder that people remain central  \\nto everything we do and everything we seek to  \\nachieve. When it comes to being a people  \\nbusiness, we will, as Fred Turner said, “never  \\nforget it.” At every location, through even the most \\ndifficult moments, our crews have stayed strong, \\nkeeping our restaurants running while providing \\nhope, inspiration and extraordinary service to our \\ncustomers and our communities.  \\nWe are proud to offer programs and resources  \\nthat support our people, both at work and at  \\nhome. Over the past two years, this has  \\nincluded simplifying our menu to improve the  \\ncrew experience, implementing COVID-19  \\nsafety measures to protect the wellbeing of  \\ncrew members, enhancing parental leave for  \\nU.S. McOpCo management, and modernizing  \\nour employee value proposition.

Last year, I was \\nproud to announce McDonald’s first ever Chief \\nCustomer Officer—Manu Steijaert—to lead the \\nnewly created Customer Experience T eam, which \\nwill ensure we stay focused on creating frictionless \\nexperiences that are seamless and memorable.  \\nManu’s appointment was complemented by \\nadditional leadership moves, including Paul Pomroy \\nas Corporate Senior Vice President, International \\nOperated Markets; and Morgan Flatley as Global  \\nChief Marketing Officer. We were also excited to \\nappoint Desiree Ralls-Morrison as our new General \\nCounsel and Corporate Secretary.  \\nI am honored to surround myself with a leadership \\nteam that elevates and expands our collective \\nthinking, and delivers results that propel our  \\nbrand forward.  Our focus on the M-C-Ds has driven broad-based  \\ngrowth in 2021. Our digital engine continues to  \\nmake the customer experience more seamless  \\nand fuels growth in the process. In our top six \\nmarkets, more than a quarter of Systemwide  \\nsales, or $18 billion, came from digital channels  \\nin 2021—a 60% increase over 2020. Three of  \\nour largest markets  —the U.S., Germany and  \\nCanada—all launched loyalty programs in 2021.  \\nWith loyalty programs now in more than 40 markets, \\nMyMcDonald’s Rewards has exceeded expectations \\nin terms of enrollment and participation. After \\njust six months in the U.S., there are more than 30 \\nmillion loyalty members enrolled and more than \\n21 million active members earning rewards. We \\nalso announced new long-term global strategic \\npartnerships to support McDelivery.  \\nWhile we expect that 2022 will be a year of  \\ncontinued progress, we also anticipate that many  \\nof the challenges we experienced in 2021 will endure. \\nFocusing on our foundational operations, expanding \\nour growing digital advantages, and continuing to \\nput the health and safety of our customers and crew \\nfirst will remain critical to executing on Accelerating \\nthe Arches.  These accomplishments highlight the \\npower of our System when we come together across \\nfunctions and geographies, and quickly follow our \\ncustomers’ lead. \\nChris Kempczinski \\nPresident and CEO \\nMcDonald’s CorporationA stronger Brand than ever before in person after so long, we asked ourselves, as we \\nhave done throughout our history, how we ensure \\nthe Brand stays relevant. The answer lies in the \\nfounding principles of our model: building a  \\nbusiness representative of our customers and \\ncommunities, where equity of opportunity is \\ncentral to our business. That’s why, late last year, \\nwe announced a new Franchisee recruitment \\ninitiative to increase the number of Franchisees \\nfrom all backgrounds, including historically \\nunderrepresented groups, in McDonald’s U.S. and  \\nall McDonald’s International Operated Markets.  \\nThis includes a $250 million commitment in the U.S. \\nover five years to provide alternatives to traditional \\nfinancing to help candidates join the McDonald’s \\nSystem. During a period of record performance, we \\nmust challenge ourselves—even more—to invest in \\nthe future. We owe that to our communities—and to \\nthe people who make up the McDonald’s System.\\nThe enduring strength of McDonald’s Brand gives  \\nus confidence that our strategy will continue to \\ndeliver sustained, long-term profitable growth  \\nfor our System and shareholders. The McDonald’s \\nBoard of Directors has provided counsel and an \\nunwavering dedication to ensure that in pursuit \\nof this objective, we continue to represent all \\nstakeholders. I want to thank them, our System,  \\nour shareholders, and our customers for their \\ncontinued support.  \\nAdditionally, I would like to thank the McDonald’s \\nBoard of Directors who have provided counsel  \\nand an unwavering dedication to represent  \\nall stakeholders.\\nAnd most importantly, on behalf of the McDonald’s \\nSystem, I extend our heartfelt gratitude to our crew. Ray Kroc built McDonald’s as the most independent \\nand interdependent Brand on the planet. We see  \\nthe power and collaborative spirit of our Brand  \\nevery single day—and together, as a System, we  \\nwill continue to bring Ray’s vision for collaboration  \\nto life, while providing customers the food they \\ncrave, experiences they treasure, and the Brand \\nthey love. It’s this commitment that will  accelerate \\nthe arches  while helping us feed and foster \\ncommunities, everywhere. \\nEarlier in April and for the first time in four years, \\nwe came together as a System at our Worldwide \\nConvention.
