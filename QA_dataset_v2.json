        "contexts": "ANNUAL REPORT2 0 2 3Technology and Infrastructure\nTechnology  and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and \ndevelopment of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and \ndisplay of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include \nservers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses \nnecessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to \noffer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to  initiatives to build and deploy \ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service \nand autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. Technology and infrastructure costs are generally expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and \nselling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer \nreferrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third \nparties.\nAdvertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $16.9 \nbillion , $20.6 billion , and $20.3 billion  in 2021 , 2022 , and 2023 . \nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related \nexpenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant \nand recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares \ngranted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of \nestimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately  50% of the grant date fair value is \nrecognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated \nmethod also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, \nthe adjustment  to compensation expense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method.  The \nestimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated \nestimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates \nare revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience by grant \nyear and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle \nin cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or \nexpiration. \nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net , consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets, and asset impairments \nfor physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in 2023.  \nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net , is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nMarketable equity securities valuation gains (losses) $ 11,526 $ (13,870) $ 984 \nEquity warrant valuation gains (losses)  1,315  (2,132)  26 \nUpward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies  1,866  76  40 \nForeign currency gains (losses)  (55)  (340)  65 \nOther, net  (19)  (540)  (177) \nTotal other income (expense), net $ 14,633 $ (16,806) $ 938 \n45Included in other income (expense), net  in 2022  and 2023  is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss)  of $(12.7) \nbillion  and $797 million  from our equity investment in  Rivian Automotive, Inc. (\u201cRivian\u201d). Our investment in Rivian\u2019s \npreferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian\u2019s \ninitial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock.  As \nof December 31, 2023 , we held 158 million  shares of Rivian\u2019s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 16% \nownership interest, and an approximate 15% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant \ninfluence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles  and \njointly-owned intellectual property , and one of our employees serving on Rivian\u2019s board of directors. We elected the fair value \noption to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in \u201c Marketable securities \u201d on our consolidated balance \nsheets, and  had a fair v alue of $2.9 billion  and $3.7 billion  as of December 31, 2022  and December 31, 2023 . The investment \nwas subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million  as of \nDecember 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022.\nRequired summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in \nmillions):\nYear Ended \nDecember 31, 2021Year Ended \nDecember 31, 2022Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nRevenues $ 55 $ 1,658 $ 3,119 \nGross profit  (465)  (3,123)  (1,424) \nLoss from operations  (4,220)  (6,856)  (4,158) \nNet loss  (4,688)  (6,752)  (3,911) \nDecember 31, 2022 September 30, 2023\nTotal current assets $ 13,130 $ 12,086 \nTotal assets  17,876  16,456 \nTotal current liabilities  2,424  2,624 \nTotal liabilities  4,077  5,904 \nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and \nlosses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We \nintend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely \noutside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such \namounts.  \nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and \nliabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates \nexpected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are \nevaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We \nconsider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent  cumulative \nloss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods \navailable to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. \nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (income tax contingencies). \nThe first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is \nmore likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The \nsecond step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate \nsettlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require \nperiodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our \nincome tax contingencies in income tax expense.\n46Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the \nfollowing hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 \u2014 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2  \u2014 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted \nprices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities \nin markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 \u2014 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably \navailable assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in \nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of \nsecurities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from \nor corroborated by observable market data.  We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 \nassets as of December 31, 2022  and 2023 .\nWe hold equ ity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2022  and 2023 , \nthese warrants had a fair value of $2.1 billion  and $2.2 billion , and are recorded within \u201c Other assets \u201d on our consolidated \nbalance sheets with gains and losses recognized in \u201cOther income (expense), net \u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. \nThese warrants are classified as Level 2 and 3 assets. \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and \nare valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently \navailable information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product \nvendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, \nrepresenting a write-down of inventory, was $2.8 billion  and $3.0 billion  as of December 31, 2022  and 2023 .\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon  services in connection with certain of our sellers\u2019 programs. Third-party sellers \nmaintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and \ntherefore these products are not included in our inventories.\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to \nprovide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead \ntimes and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain \nelectronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These \ncommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We \nalso have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. \nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other\nIncluded in \u201c Accounts receivable, net and other \u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to \ncustomers, vendors, and sellers, as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2022  and 2023 , \ncustomer receivables, net, were $26.6 billion  and $34.1 billion , vendor receivables, net, were $6.9 billion  and $8.5 billion , seller \nreceivables, net, were $1.3 billion  and $1.0 billion , and other receivables, net, were $3.1 billion  and $3.3 billion . Seller \nreceivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to \nprocure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $4.5 billion  and $5.4 billion  as of December 31, 2022  and \nDecember 31, 2023 .\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. \nReceivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected \nin accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.1 billion , $1.4 billion , and $1.7 \nbillion  as of December 31, 2021 , 2022 , and 2023 . Additions to the allowance were $1.0 billion , $1.6 billion , and $1.9 billion , \nand deductions to the allowance were $1.1 billion , $1.3 billion , and $1.6 billion  in 2021 , 2022 , and 2023 .\n47Software Development Costs\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use \nsoftware, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, \nincluding those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. \nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from \nproperty and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, \nalong with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the \nconstruction period and finance lease arrangements.  Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, \nheavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment . Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the \nestimated useful lives of the assets  (generally the lesser of 40 years  or the remaining life of the underlying building, four years  \nprior to January 1, 2022 and five years  subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our servers,  five years  prior to January 1, 2022 and six \nyears  subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our networking equipment, ten years  for heavy equipment, and three  to ten years  for \nother fulfillment equipment).  Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense \ncategories on our consolidated statements of operations.  \nLeases\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are \ngenerally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired \nunder finance leases are recorded in \u201c Property and equipment, net .\u201d All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our \nleases generally have terms that range from one to ten years  for equipment and one to twenty years  for property.\nCertain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of \nproperty, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are \naccounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone \nprices.\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a \ndiscount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present \nvalue of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease \nprepayments reclassified from \u201c Other assets \u201d upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and \namortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase \nthe leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the \nclassification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes \nin price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. \nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the \nterm of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the \nestimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. \nThe interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method \nover the lease term.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the \ntermination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded \nliabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\nFinancing Obligations\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have \ncontrol over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the \narrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful \nlife or the term of the obligation. \nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are \nderecognized, and we classify the lease as operating. \n48Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event \noccurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative \nassessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset \nis less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and \nindefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, \nwe recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash \nflows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily \non expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible \nassets as of April 1, 2023 , resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their \ncarrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See \u201cNote 5 \u2014 Acquisitions, \nGoodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.\u201d\nOther Assets\nIncluded in \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, \nnet of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; \nequity warrant assets and certain equity investments; satellite network launch services deposits; and affordable housing loans. \nWe recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the \nagreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These \nincentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses.\nDigital Video and Music Content\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing \nagreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the \nlicense fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we \nrecognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we \namortize the asset to \u201c Cost of sales \u201d on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line \nbasis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are \nexpensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to \n\u201cCost of sales \u201d predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. \nThe weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.5 years . We review usage and viewing patterns \nimpacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively. \nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each \nmajor geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an \nevent occurs or circumstances change in dicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of \nvideo, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2022  and 2023  were $16.7 billion  and $17.4 billion . \nTotal video and music expense was $16.6 billion  and $18.9 billion  for the year ended December 31, 2022  and 2023 . Total video \nand music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, \nand costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\nInvestments\nWe generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term \nmarketable debt securities. Such investments are included in \u201c Cash and cash equivalents \u201d or \u201c Marketable securities \u201d on the \naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.  \nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses \nincluded in \u201c Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) .\u201d Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair \nvalue below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a \nforecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through \u201c Other income (expense), net \u201d on our \nconsolidated statements of operations. \nConvertible notes classified as available for sale, equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the \nability to exercise significant influence and accounted for at cost, and equity investments accounted for using the equity method \nof accounting are included within \u201c Other assets \u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.\n49In Q3 2023 , we invested in a $1.25 billion  note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. The note is \nclassified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in \u201cAccumulated other \ncomprehensive income (loss) .\u201d The note is classified as a Level 3 asset.  We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest \nup to an additional $2.75 billion  in a second convertible note. We also have a commercial arrangement primarily for the \nprovision of AWS cloud services, which includes the use of AWS chips.\nEquity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are \naccounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, with adjustments recognized in \u201c Other \nincome (expense), net \u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative \nassessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and \ntrends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we \nwrite it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2022  and 2023 , these investments had a carrying value of $715 \nmillion  and $754 million .\nEquity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value \noption, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the \nearnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and \nimpairments, if any, are recognized in \u201c Equity-method investment activity, net of tax \u201d on our consolidated statements of \noperations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary \nand if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. \nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair \nvalue option, are included in \u201c Marketable securities \u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with \nchanges recognized in \u201c Other income (expense), net \u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. \nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets,  other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,  are reviewed for impairment whenever \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that \nwould necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a \nsignificant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate \nthat the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset\u2019s carrying \namount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss \nbased on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale \nwhen certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for \nsale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at \nthe lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were  not significant as of December 31, 2022  and 2023 .\nAccrued Expenses and Other\nIncluded in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and \nasset retirement obligations, tax-related liabilities, current debt, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, self-\ninsurance liabilities, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2022  and 2023 , our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.7 billion  and our liabilities for \nunredeemed gift cards were $5.4 billion  and $5.3 billion . We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. \nThe portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nAlthough we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively self-\ninsure for exposure primarily related to workers\u2019 compensation, employee health care benefits, general and product liability, \nand automobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate self-\ninsurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development, \ninflation, and other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement \namounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the \nfourth  quarter of 2022 , we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion  primarily \ndriven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in \u201c Cost of \nsales \u201d on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment. Increases to our reserves driven \nby changes in estimates were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021  and \n502023 . As of December 31, 2022  and 2023 , our total self-insurance liabilities were $4.0 billion  and $6.3 billion  and are included \nin \u201cAccrued expenses and other \u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.  \nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is \nrecognized over the service period.  Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime \nmemberships.  Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022  was $16.1 billion , of which $12.4 billion  was recognized as \nrevenue during the year ended December 31, 2023  and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023  was $20.6 billion . \nIncluded in \u201c Other long-term liabilities \u201d on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.9 billion  and $5.7 billion  of unearned \nrevenue as of December 31, 2022  and 2023 . \nAdditionally,  we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with com mitments in  customer \ncontracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that \nexceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $155.7 billion  as of December 31, 2023 . The weighted average \nremaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.0 years . However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven \nby customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nIncluded in \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing \nobligations, unearned revenue, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, digital video and music content, and deferred tax \nliabilities.\nForeign Currency\nWe have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly \nincurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that \neither operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are \ntranslated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates \nprevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in \u201c Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ,\u201d a \nseparate component of stockholders\u2019 equity. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a \ncurrency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in \u201c Other income (expense), net \u201d on our \nconsolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we \nrecorded gains (losses) of  $19 million , $386 million , and $(329) million  in 2021 , 2022 , and 2023 .\nAccounting  Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) \namending existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the \neffective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with \nearly adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We are currently evaluating the ASU to \ndetermine its impact on our income tax disclosures. \n51Note 2 \u2014 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2022  and 2023 , our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily \nconsisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade \nsecurities, and marketable equity securities.

This \nincrease was attributed to growth in our profit and operating efficiency.\nFinancial Risk Management\nIn 2023, we closely monitored the changes in our external environment and proactively assessed their impact on \nHuawei using the financial risk management system we have built over the past years. In addition, we continued \nto amend and improve our financial risk management policies and processes to further enhance our ability to \nwithstand financial risks and better support our business development.\nLiquidity Risk\nWe have continuously worked to improve our capital structure and short-term liquidity planning, budgeting, and \nforecasting systems to better assess mid- to long-term liquidity needs and short-term funding shortfalls. We \nhave implemented prudent financial measures to meet our liquidity needs and guarantee our company's business \ndevelopment, including maintaining a robust capital structure and financial flexibility, keeping a proper level of \nfunds, gaining access to adequate and committed credit facilities, creating effective cash plans, and centralizing \ncash management. As of December 31, 2023, our cash and short-term investments amounted to CNY475,317 \nmillion, which shows that we properly managed our liquidity risks.\n(CNY Million) 2023 2022 YoY\nCash flow from operating activities 69,807 17,797 292.2%\nCash and short-term investments 475,317 373,452 27.3%\nShort-term and long-term borrowings 308,414 197,144 56.4%\nForeign Exchange Risk\nOur presentation currency is CNY, but w e have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling, and financing in \ncurrencies other than CNY. According to our established foreign exchange risk management policy, material foreign \nexchange exposures are hedged based on a comprehensive analysis of market liquidity and hedging costs. We have \ndeveloped a complete set of foreign exchange management policies, processes, and instructions. These include:\n\u25a0 Natural hedging: We structure our operations to match currencies between procurement and sales transactions, \nto the greatest extent possible.\n\u25a0 Financial hedging: For certain currencies where natural hedging does not fully offset the foreign currency \nposition, we hedge through forward foreign exchange transactions. In countries where local currencies \ndepreciate sharply or that have strict foreign exchange controls, we manage foreign exchange exposures using \ndifferent measures, including exchange rate protection and financial hedging. We have also adopted solutions \nlike accelerating customer payment and promptly tra nsferring cash out of these countries to minimize risks.90       Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd.With other conditions remaining unchanged, exchange rate fluctuations would impact our net profit as follows:\n(CNY Million) 2023 2022\nUSD depreciates by 5% 347 1,013\nEUR depreciates by 5% (28) (106)\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risks mainly arise from Huawei's long-term borrowings. By analyzing interest rate exposures, the \ncompany uses a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate financing tools to mitigate these interest rate risks.\n1. Major interest-bearing long-term financial instruments held by the company as at December 31, 2023\n2023 2022\nEffective\nInterest Rate(%)(CNY Million)Effective\nInterest Rate(%)(CNY Million)\nFixed-rate long-term financial instruments:\n Long-term borrowings3.64 61,676 3.74 53,219\nFloating-rate long-term financial instruments:\n Long-term borrowings3.69 230,013 3.86 129,964\nTotal 291,688 183,183\n2. Sensitivity analysis\nAssuming that the interest rate increased by 50 basis points on December 31, 2023 and other variables remained \nunchanged, the company's net profit and equity would decrease by CNY956 million (in 2022, the amount decreased \nby CNY533 million).\nCredit Risk\nThe company has established and implemented globally consistent credit management policies, processes, IT \nsystems, and quantitative credit risk assessment tools. It has established dedicated credit management teams across \nall regions and business units, and set up centers of expertise specializing in credit management in Europe and \nAsia Pacific. The company uses quantitative risk assessment models to determine customer credit ratings and credit \nlimits and quantify transaction risks. It has also set risk control points for key activities across the end-to-end sales \nprocess to manage credit risks in a closed loop. Huawei's Credit Management Department regularly assesses global \ncredit risk exposures and develops IT tools to help field offices monitor risk status, estimate potential losses, and \ndetermine bad debt provisions as appropriate. To minimize risk, a special process is followed if a customer defaults \non a payment or poses an unacceptably high credit risk.\nSales Financing\nWith its global coverage, Huawei's sales financing team maintains close contact with customers to understand \ntheir financing needs and taps into a wide range of financing resources around the world. As a bridge for \ncommunication and cooperation between financial institutions and customers, the sales financing team provides \ncustomers with specialized financing solutions that contribute to ongoing customer success. Huawei remains \ncommitted to working with our financing partners to build a mutually beneficial financing ecosystem. Therefore, \nwe engage our partner financial institutions to provide sales financing facilities in export credit, leasing, factoring \nand other products with financial institutions undertaking risks and realizing the returns. Huawei has established \nsystematic financing policies and project approval processes to strictly control financing risk exposures. Huawei \nonly shares risks with financial institutions on certain projects, and measures and recognizes the risk exposures to \nensure that business risks are under control.2023 Annual Report        91Management's responsibilities \nfor the consolidated financial \nstatements summary\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the \nconsolidated financial statements summary on the \nbasis described in note 2 to the consolidated financial \nstatements summary.\nAuditors' responsibilities\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on whether \nthe consolidated financial statements summary is \nconsistent, in all material respects, with the audited \nconsolidated financial statements based on our \nprocedures, which were conducted in accordance with \nInternational Standard on Auditing 810 (Revised), \nEngagements to Report on Summary Financial \nStatements.\nKPMG Huazhen LLP\nCertified Public Accountants\n15th Floor, China Resources Tower\n2666 Keyuan South Road\nShenzhen 518052, China\nMarch 27, 2024Independent auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements \nsummary to the Board of Directors of  \nHuawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd.\nOpinion\nThe consolidated financial statements summary \nof Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd. and its \nsubsidiaries (the Group) set out on pages 92 to 134, \nwhich comprises the summary consolidated statement \nof financial position as at December 31, 2023, the \nsummary consolidated statement of profit or loss \nand other comprehensive income and the summary \nconsolidated statement of cash flows for the year \nthen ended, and related notes, is derived from the \naudited consolidated financial statements of the \nGroup for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated \nfinancial statements summary is consistent, in all \nmaterial respects, with the audited consolidated \nfinancial statements, on the basis described in note 2 \nto the consolidated financial statements summary.\nConsolidated financial statements \nsummary\nThe consolidated financial statements summary \ndoes not contain all the disclosures required by IFRS \nAccounting Standards.

(the Company) \nis a limited liability company established in Shenzhen \nin the People's Republic of China (PRC).  The \nCompany's registered office is at Building 1, Zone B, \nHuawei Base, Bantian, Longgang District, Shenzhen \nCity, PRC. The Company's ultimate controlling party is \nthe Union.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) \nprincipally provide information and communications \ntechnology (ICT) infrastructure and smart \ndevices.  This includes providing products, services \nand solutions to customers in the fields of \ncommunications networks, IT, smart devices, cloud \nservices, digital power and intelligent automotive \nsolutions.  The principal activities and other \nparticulars of the Company's major subsidiaries are \nset out in note 32(b) to the consolidated financial \nstatements summary.\n2  Preparation basis of the \nconsolidated financial statements \nsummary\nThe Group has prepared a full set of consolidated \nfinancial statements (consolidated financial \nstatements) for the year ended December 31, 2023 in \naccordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.\nThe consolidated financial statements summary has \nbeen prepared and presented based on the audited \nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023 in order to disclose material \nfinancial information relating to the Group's business \noperation.\n3 Material accounting policies\n(a) Basis of preparation of the consolidated \nfinancial statements\nThe consolidated financial statements have been \nprepared under the historical cost basis modified \nfor the fair valuation of some financial instrument \nclassifications (see note 3(e)).\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial \nstatements requires management to make \njudgments, estimates and assumptions that affect \nthe application of policies and reported amounts \nof assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and associated assumptions are based \non historical experience and various other factors \nthat are believed to be reasonable under the \ncircumstances.  Actual results may differ from \nthese estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are \nreviewed regularly and revised when required.  \nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognized \nin the period in which the estimate is revised if the \nrevision affects only that period, or in the period \nof the revision and future periods if the revision \naffects both current and future periods.\nJudgments made by management in the \napplication of IFRS Accounting Standards that have \nsignificant effect on the consolidated financial \nstatements and major sources of estimation \nuncertainty are discussed in note 4.\n(b) Functional and presentation currency\nAll financial information in the consolidated \nfinancial statements summary is presented in \nmillions of Chinese Yuan (CNY), which is the \nCompany's functional currency.\n(c) Consolidation\n(i) Business combinations\nThe Group accounts for business combinations \nusing the acquisition method when the acquired \nset of activities and assets meets the definition of \na business and control is transferred to the Group.  \nTo be considered a business, an acquiree must \ncomprise inputs and a substantive process that \ntogether significantly contribute to the ability to \ncreate outputs.  \nThe Group may determine that an acquired \nset of activities and assets is not a business if \nsubstantially all of the fair value of the gross \nassets acquired is concentrated in a single \nidentifiable asset or group of similar identifiable \nassets.\nThe consideration transferred in the acquisition \nis generally measured at fair value, as are the \nidentifiable assets and liabilities.  Any goodwill \nthat arises is tested annually for impairment (see \nnote 3(k)(ii)).  Any gain on a bargain purchase \nis recognized in profit or loss immediately.  \nTransaction costs are expensed as incurred.2023 Annual Report        97(ii) Subsidiaries\nThe financial statements consolidate the results, \nassets, liabilities and cash flows of all subsidiaries \nwhich the Group controls.\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date that \ncontrol commences until the date that control \nceases.  Intra-group balances, transactions, cash \nflows and any unrealized gains arising from  \nintra-group transactions are eliminated in \npreparing the consolidated financial statements.  \nUnrealized losses resulting from intra-group \ntransactions are eliminated in the same way as \nunrealized gains but only to the extent that there \nis no evidence of impairment.\nThe Group controls an entity when it is exposed, \nor has rights, to variable returns from its \ninvolvement with the entity and has the ability to \naffect those returns through its power over the \nentity.  When assessing whether the Group has \npower, only substantive rights are considered.\n(iii) Non-controlling interests\nNon-controlling interests represent the carrying \nvalue of the net assets of subsidiaries attributable \nto non-controlling equity holders.  The Group \nmeasures non-controlling interests at the  \nnon-controlling interests' proportionate share of \nthe subsidiary's net identifiable assets.  Changes \nin the Group's interests in a subsidiary that do \nnot result in a loss of control are accounted for \nas equity transactions, whereby adjustments are \nmade to the amounts of controlling and  \nnon-controlling interests within consolidated \nequity to reflect the change in relative interests, \nbut no adjustments are made to goodwill and no \ngain or loss is recognized. \n(iv) Loss of control\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it is \naccounted for as a disposal of the entire interest \nin that subsidiary, with a resulting gain or loss \nbeing recognized in profit or loss.  Any interest \nretained in that former subsidiary at the date \nwhen control is lost is recognized at fair value or, \nwhen appropriate, the cost on initial recognition \nof an investment in an associate or a joint venture \n(see note 3(d)).(d) Associates and joint ventures\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group \nhas significant influence, but not control or \njoint control, over its management, including \nparticipation in the financial and operating policy \ndecisions.\nA joint venture is an arrangement whereby the \nGroup and other parties contractually agree to \nshare control of the arrangement, and have rights \nto the net assets of the arrangement.\nAn investment in an associate or a joint venture \nis accounted for in the consolidated financial \nstatements using the equity method until the \ndate on which significant influence or joint control \nceases.  It is initially recognized at cost and \nsubsequently adjusted to include the Group's share \nof the profit or loss and other comprehensive \nincome (OCI) of the associate or the joint venture.\nUnrealized profits and losses resulting from \ntransactions between the Group and its associates \nand joint ventures are eliminated to the extent \nof the Group's interest in the investee, except \nwhere unrealized losses provide evidence of an \nimpairment of the asset transferred, in which case \nthey are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n(e) Financial instruments \n(i) Recognition and derecognition \nFinancial instruments, comprising financial assets \nand financial liabilities, are recognized in the \nconsolidated statement of financial position when \nthe Group becomes a party to the contractual \nprovisions of the instrument.\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when \nthe contractual rights to the cash flows from the \nasset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive \nthe contractual cash flows in a transaction in \nwhich substantially all of the risks and rewards of \nownership of the financial asset are transferred or \nwhere it neither transfers nor retains substantially \nall of the risks and rewards of ownership and \nloses control.  When control is retained, the Group \ncontinues to recognize the financial asset to the \nextent of its continuing involvement.  Financial \nassets are also derecognized when they are \nwritten off.  Financial assets are written off when \nthere is no reasonable expectation of further \nrecoveries even though there may be enforcement \nactions ongoing.98       Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd.The Group derecognizes a financial liability \nwhen its contractual obligations are discharged, \ncanceled, or expire.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are \noffset and the net amount presented in the \nconsolidated statement of financial position \nwhen, and only when, the Group currently has a \nlegally enforceable right to set off the recognized \namounts and intends either to settle them on a \nnet basis or to realize the asset and settle the \nliability simultaneously.\n(ii) Classification and measurement\nAll financial assets and liabilities are initially \nrecognized at fair value, with the exception of \ntrade receivables without a significant financing \ncomponent, which are measured at their \ntransaction price, determined in accordance with \nthe Group's accounting policies for revenue.  \nSubsequently, measurement depends on the \nfinancial assets/liabilities classification as follows:\n\u25a0 Financial assets measured at fair value through \nprofit or loss (FVPL)\nNon-equity financial assets are classified as \nFVPL if they arise from contracts which do \nnot give rise to cash flows which are solely \nprincipal and interest, or otherwise where they \nare held in a business model which mainly \nrealizes them through sale.  Such assets are \nre-measured to fair value at the end of each \nreporting period.  Gains and losses arising \nfrom re-measurement are taken to profit or \nloss, as are transaction costs.\nEquity investments are classified as FVPL \nunless they are designated as at FVOCI on \ninitial recognition (see below).  Dividends from \nequity investments, irrespective of whether \nclassified as FVPL or FVOCI, are recognized in \nprofit or loss as finance income.\n\u25a0 Financial assets measured at FVOCI\nNon-equity financial assets are classified as \nFVOCI where they arise from contracts that \ngive rise to contractual cash flows which \nare solely principal and interest and that are \nheld in a business model which realizes some \nthrough sale and some by holding them to \nsettlement.  They are recognized initially at fair \nvalue plus any directly attributable transaction \ncosts, or in the case of trade receivables, at the \ntransaction price.  At the end of each reporting period they are \nre-measured to fair value, with the cumulative \ngain or loss compared to their amortized cost \n(AC) being recognized as fair value reserve \nthrough other comprehensive income, except \nfor the recognition in profit or loss of expected \ncredit losses, interest income (calculated using \nthe effective interest method) and foreign \nexchange gains and losses.\nWhen these assets are derecognized, the \ncumulative gain or loss is reclassified from \nequity to profit or loss.\nEquity investments are designated as at \nFVOCI where they are considered strategic to \nthe Group.  Such designation is made on an \ninstrument-by-instrument basis, but may only \nbe made if the investment meets the definition \nof equity from the issuer's perspective.  \nAmounts accumulated in the fair value reserve \nin respect of these investments are transferred \ndirectly to retained earnings on the disposal \nof the investment.  These investments are not \nsubject to impairment.\n\u25a0 Financial assets measured at amortized cost\nFinancial assets are held at amortized cost \nwhen they arise from contracts that give rise \nto contractual cash flows which are solely \nprincipal and interest and are held in a \nbusiness model that mainly holds the assets to \ncollect contractual cash flows.  \nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost \nwhen they are not purchased or originated \ncredit-impaired are measured at amortized \ncost using the effective interest method.  For \nthose purchased or originated credit-impaired, \nthe Group applies the credit-adjusted effective \ninterest rate since initial recognition.  These \nassets are also subject to impairment losses \n(see note 3(k)).  Interest income is calculated \nbased on the gross carrying amount of the \nfinancial asset unless the financial asset is \ncredit impaired, in which case interest income \nis calculated on the amortized cost (i.e. gross \ncarrying amount less loss allowance). Interest \nincome is included in finance income.\n\u25a0 Financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured \nat amortized cost or FVPL. A financial liability \nis classified as FVPL if it is a derivative, \ncontingent consideration or it is designated "

Now it\u2019s the \nfoundation of everything in an increasingly intelligent \nworld. Huawei is doing what it can to help our \ncustomers get ready for the future.\nFor mobile and home users, Huawei teams up with \ncarriers to provide an ultra-broadband experience \nacross all aspects of everyday life through gigabit 5G, \noptical, and Wi-Fi networks.\nFor government and enterprise customers, \nHuawei works with our partners to enable digital \ntransformation. We provide intelligent connectivity \nsolutions, including ubiquitous ultra-broadband, \ndeterministic experience, and hyper-automation, to \nsupport the diverse needs of all enterprises.\nWe\u2019re on a nonstop mission to push connectivity to \nits limits with products and solutions like 5G, 5G core \n(one core and cloud-native architecture), best-in-class \nWi-Fi 6, intelligent and lossless data center networks, \noptical cross-connect (OXC), and intelligent optical \nnetwork terminals (ONTs). And as more industries go \ndigital, we\u2019re using AI to enable hyper-automation of \nnetwork O&M and developing new algorithms to pave \nthe way for truly deterministic IP networks.\nWe believe that ICT will be pivotal to building \na greener world and promoting the sustainable \ndevelopment of society at large. We develop network \nsolutions for green sites, networks, and network \noperations, as well as more efficient and low-carbon \nenergy solutions. We are also working with our \necosystem partners to deploy more energy-efficient ICT \ninfrastructure. Together, we want to make ubiquitous \nconnectivity a greener possibility.Pervasive Intelligence\nData has become a valuable raw material these days, \nand computing power has become the new driver \nof productivity. The amount of data we produce will \nexplode as more and more of the devices around us \nbecome smart, and many industries will need massive, \nintelligent storage capabilities to handle these new \nresources. Abundant and affordable computing power \nwill determine the future of the digital economy.\nThrough nonstop innovation in data storage, diversified \ncomputing, and cloud services, Huawei is helping \nindustries go digital by making pervasive intelligence \npossible. Together we will build a fully intelligent \nworld.\nIn data storage, Huawei\u2019s converged, intelligent, and \nopen data infrastructure is helping break down silos \nbetween storage, databases, and big data systems. \nHuawei\u2019s data management engine enables customers \nto integrate and optimize every step of the data \nlifecycle, from storage and computing to management \nand utilization. This helps maximize value per bit and \nreduce cost per bit to unlock the full potential of data.\nIn computing, Huawei is constantly developing \ninnovative computing systems and architectures, \npushing the boundaries of engineering, and driving \nsynergies between basic software and hardware. \nWe believe open hardware, open source software, \npartner enablement, and talent cultivation are key \nto developing the Kunpeng, Ascend, and openEuler \necosystems, which in turn will bring more diversified \ncomputing power to the whole world.\nIn cloud services, Huawei Cloud is working to offer \neverything as a service. Through this unit, we are \ntranslating the company\u2019s 30 plus years of ICT \nknow-how into a wide variety of cloud services, \nincluding Infrastructure as a Service, Technology as a \nService, and Expertise as a Service. These services aim \nto make the computing power required for AI as easily \naccessible as water and electricity. To this end, Huawei \nwill continue to innovate in foundational technologies, \nplatforms, and talent. We are also working to make AI \nmore affordable, make it as accessible and available \nas possible, and help cultivate a new, thriving AI \necosystem.\n20       Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd.Personalized Experience\nThe physical and digital worlds are converging, and \nthe process is speeding up. Mass production is giving \nway to mass customization, leading to greater business \ninnovation, collaboration across ecosystems, and a \nricher user experience. \nUsing new technologies like AI and cloud, \nbusinesses can better understand their customers\u2019 \nneeds and innovate with greater agility to craft a \nmore personalized experience. Coordination and \ncollaboration across industries will drive innovation at \nscale.\nIn our user-centric intelligent world, usage scenarios \nand experiences are evolving.

Powerful digital platforms are needed to \nintegrate this data.\nNew technologies in connectivity, cloud, AI, computing, \nand industry applications are converging to support \ncomprehensive intelligent connections between \npeople, things, and information at multiple levels. \nThese technologies will help industries expand their \ntraditional boundaries, and enable governments \nand enterprises to expedite intelligent upgrade. \nEnterprises will have to adapt their business \nstrategies, organization, processes, marketing, services, \nmanufacturing, and R&D to cope with changes. To \ndo so, enterprises need to synergize cloud, networks, \nedge, and devices to build an open, powerful \ndigital platform with multi-dimensional perception, \nall-domain collaboration, accurate judgment, and \ncontinuous evolution. With cloud as the foundation \nand AI at its core, this digital platform helps users \naccumulate industry know-how, rapidly innovate their \ncore business processes, and quickly iterate to respond \nto new competition and changes in their business \nenvironments.\nA digital platform is one of the core engines \nthat drives success in digital transformation. New \ninformation technologies can make organizations \nmore efficient through intelligent management of their \nphysical assets like buildings, factories, production \nlines, and utilities.

consumer preferences, improve local business performance and \nincrease the value of the McDonald's brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating \nrestaurants.\nThe Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business \nrelationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all McDonald\u2019 s restaurants. Conventional franchisees \ncontribute to the Company\u2019s revenue, primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified \nminimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. The Company's \nheavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales, \nand resulting cash flow streams.\nDevelopmental License or Affiliate\nUnder a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing their businesses, providing \ncapital (including the real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any capital \nunder a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally receives initial \nfees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. \nWhile developmental license and affiliate arrangements are largely the same, affiliate arrangements are used in a limited number of \nforeign markets (primarily China and Japan) within the International Developmental Licensed Markets segment as well as a limited number \nof individual restaurants within the International Operated Markets segment, where the Company also has an equity investment and records \nits share of net results in equity in earnings of unconsolidated af filiates.\nPURPOSE, MISSION AND VALUES\nThrough its size and scale, McDonald's embraces and prioritizes its role and commitment to the communities in which it operates through its \npurpose  to feed and foster communities, and its mission  to make delicious feel-good moments easy for everyone. The Company is guided \nby five core values  that define who it is and how it runs the business across the three-legged stool of McDonald\u2019 s franchisees, suppliers, and \nemployees:\n1.Serve  \u2013 We put our customers and people first; \n2.Inclusion  \u2013 We open our doors to everyone; \n3.Integrity  \u2013 We do the right thing; \n4.Community  \u2013 We are good neighbors; and \n5.Family  \u2013 We get better together. \nThe Company believes that its people, all around the world, set it apart and bring these values to life daily .\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \nThe Company\u2019s people strategies aim to create an inclusive environment that represents the communities in which we operate. To do this, \nthe Company continues to evaluate and evolve compensation and benefits programs to remain locally relevant and competitive, of fers \nquality training and learning opportunities and upholds high standards of health and safety to create and maintain a safe and respectful \nworkplace for its employees. \nYou can find more information about the Company's human capital management and related initiatives on the \u201cOur Purpose & Impact\u201d \nsection of its website, which is updated annually.\nOur People\nCompany employees, which include those in the Company's corporate and other of fices as well as in Company-owned and operated \nrestaurants, totaled over 150,000 worldwide as of year-end 2023, of which approximately 70% were based outside of the U.S. In addition to \nCompany employees, the over two million individuals who work in McDonald's franchised restaurants around the world are critical to the \nCompany\u2019s success, enabling it to drive long-term value creation and further its purpose and mission. People are at the cornerstone of the \nCompany's business and an essential part of the System.\nOur Commitment to Inclusion\nAt McDonald\u2019s, inclusion is one of our five Core Values, and we strive to integrate our values into our business operations to deliver an \ninclusive experience for our stakeholders\u2014including employees, franchisees, suppliers, customers and the communities we serve.\nUnder the leadership of its Board of Directors, the Company adheres to a global diversity , equity, and inclusion (\"DEI\") strategy which is \ncritical to its success. The DEI strategy is designed to drive efforts across the System to better represent the diverse communities in which \nMcDonald\u2019s operates, to accelerate cultures of inclusion and belonging, upholding human rights and cultivating a respectful workplace that \nis ethical, truthful and dependable, and to further dismantle barriers to economic opportunity . Additionally, it includes:\n\u2022 ongoing efforts at all levels of the Company to help improve the representation of women globally and underrepresented groups in \nthe U.S.;\t\n\u2022 a commitment to equal pay among Company employees with comparable job responsibilities, experience, performance, and \ncontributions, as well as fair treatment in access, opportunity and advancement for all;\n\u2022 the Company\u2019s Mutual Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (\u201cMCDEI\u201d), a pledge that invites the Company\u2019s U.S.-based \nsuppliers to commit to efforts toward DEI progress within their own organizations, draws on McDonald\u2019s size and scale, and \nhighlights its opportunity to accelerate meaningful change for employees, franchisees, suppliers, customers, and communities; \n\u2022 a recruitment initiative designed to increase the number of franchisees from all backgrounds, including underrepresented groups in \nthe Company\u2019s U.S. and International Operated Markets segments, by reducing upfront equity requirements for eligible franchisee \ncandidates and providing ongoing learning and development; and\n4McDonald's Corporation 2023 Annual Report    \u2022 best practice sharing with franchisees and suppliers to support them in furthering inclusion within their own organizations.\nTo reinforce the importance of the Company\u2019s values, the Company\u2019s annual incentive plan includes financial performance metrics, as \nwell as strategic measures that hold executives accountable for ef forts towards the Company\u2019s DEI ambitions.\nPlease see the Company\u2019s Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report on the Company's website, which reflects data on employee, \nBoard and franchisee representation, as well as diverse-owned supplier spend and equal pay .\nRespectful Workplace Environment\nFostering safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces, wherever McDonald's does business, has been integral to the Company for its more \nthan 65-year history. The Company understands the importance of providing a positive experience and making everyone feel valued, both in \nits offices and in McDonald's restaurants. The Company\u2019s commitment to human rights is set forth in its Human Rights Policy and is \nfurthered by its Standards of Business Conduct, which apply to Company employees, and its Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets forth \nhuman rights requirements for the Company's global suppliers. Company employees are trained on and are required to annually certify their \nunderstanding of, and commitment to upholding, the Standards of Business Conduct. \nMcDonald\u2019s focus on fostering safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces starts at the beginning of each restaurant crew member\u2019s \nrecruitment journey. In 2022, the Company published its Responsible and Ethical Recruitment Principles outlining its commitment to working \ntoward five global standards that apply to migrant labor recruiting practices across the Company , franchisees, and International \nDevelopmental licensees. Additionally, in 2023, the Company became a member of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, \nwhich is a collaborative effort to drive positive change in how the Company recruits migrant workers, and joined the Human Rights Coalition \nof Consumer Goods Forum, which is a coalition of the largest consumer goods brands working to end forced labor . \nFurther, the Company\u2019s Global Brand Standards (which apply to all McDonald\u2019s restaurants, whether Company-owned or franchised) \nprioritize action in four areas: harassment, discrimination, and retaliation prevention; workplace violence prevention; restaurant employee \nfeedback; and health and safety.\nAs part of its commitment to a respectful workplace environment, the Company recognizes how important it is to provide channels for its \nemployees to report human rights and similar concerns that may violate Company policies and standards. Employees can do so in many \nways, including through an anonymous global reporting channel, the Business Integrity Line, which is staf fed by a live operator from an \nindependent company and is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This is complemented by additional reporting channels in many \nmarkets. The Company expects its employees, franchisees, and suppliers to uphold human rights and cultivate respectful workplaces, which \nbuilds trust, protects the integrity of the McDonald's brand and fuels Systemwide success.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Talent Development\nThe compensation and benefits provided to U.S. and internationally-based Company employees, including both corporate staf f and \nCompany-owned restaurant employees, is established based upon competitive considerations in the relevant labor market. The amount and \ntype of compensation varies by an employee's level and location, and typically includes some combination of the following (in addition to \nbase pay): cash bonuses, stock-based awards, retirement savings programs, and health and welfare benefits. Company employees may \nalso receive paid time off, family care resources, tuition assistance and flexible work schedules.\nIn 2021, the Company publicly communicated its ongoing commitment to equal pay , which is supported by an annual pay gap analysis \nthat aims to ensure equitable pay practices are consistently implemented and executed across the Company . \nResults of the 2023 pay gap analysis demonstrated continuous annual progress by showing that women globally in Company owned \nand operated markets were paid 99.96 cents on the dollar in base pay on average of what men were paid for similar work. Further , there \nwas no base pay gap disfavoring underrepresented groups in the U.S. These results indicate the Company substantially attained equal pay , \nand in 2024, intends to close the small gaps identified in line with our commitment to close pay gaps identified in annual equal pay analyses. \nThe Company continuously emphasizes the importance of pay that is competitive, non-discriminatory , performance-based, transparent, \nand compliant with legal and regulatory standards. \nAdditionally, the Company has a long-standing commitment to providing training, education benefits and career path opportunities, that \nempower its people. Learning and development is a competitive advantage to McDonald\u2019 s and a true differentiator to its employee value \nproposition. McDonald\u2019s Hamburger University has multiple campuses around the world, as well as online and on-demand resources, that \nprovide training for Company employees, as well as franchisees and their eligible employees. The Company is committed to providing \nopportunities for people to enhance their skills and fulfill their potential through talent development programs, apprenticeship opportunities, \nand language and technical skill training and support for continuing education, as it believes this helps to facilitate talent attraction, career \ndevelopment, and retention.\nCommunities\nMcDonald\u2019s embraces its role and commitment to the communities it serves. Through its Youth Opportunity program, the Company aims to \nreduce barriers to employment for two million youth by 2025 through supporting pre-employment job readiness training, employment \nopportunities and workplace development programs. \nThe Company is also proud to support the network of over 260 local chapters of Ronald McDonald House Charities (\u201cRMHC\u201d) spanning \nover 60 countries and regions that creates, finds and supports programs that directly improve the health and well-being of children and their \nfamilies. The Company continues to deliver against its five-year, $100 million commitment to RMHC, which it announced in 2020.\nIn addition, the Company maintains a Global Food Disposition Policy to help support its suppliers and distributors around the world in \ndisposing of food in alignment with McDonald\u2019s food waste hierarchy, enabling food donations wherever possible. The Policy, which aims to \navoid food waste and loss while also allowing the System to meet the needs of local communities, is a critical part of the Company's \nsustainability work and its purpose to feed and foster communities. \n \nMcDonald's Corporation 2023 Annual Report    5The Company continues to bring its community impact strategy to life and enhance its support ef forts because its business thrives when \nits communities thrive. McDonald\u2019s creates opportunities that encourage Company employees, franchisees and their employees, suppliers, \nand customers to get involved in philanthropic and volunteering opportunities. \nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Company prioritizes action and progress across a range of environmental matters, and endeavors to improve its long-term sustainability \nand resiliency, which benefit the System and the communities McDonald's serves. The Company monitors environmental regulations and \nstakeholder expectations to be well positioned to respond in a timely and appropriate manner , as it cannot predict the precise nature of how \nthese matters will continue to evolve. Although any impact would likely vary by geographic region and/or market, the adoption of new \nenvironmental laws or regulations may increase costs and/or operational complexity for the Company .\nTo guide its management of environmental matters and to strengthen its resiliency, the Company has developed goals and \ncommitments that are informed by relevant frameworks, including the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). These \ninclude initiatives to reduce Systemwide greenhouse gas emissions, support deforestation free sourcing throughout the Company's global \nsupply chain, efficiently manage natural resources and support biodiversity, responsibly source ingredients and packaging, and increase the \navailability of recycling in restaurants to reduce waste. These are areas of increasing importance to the Company and its stakeholders and \nwhere the Company believes it can have an impact and help to drive industry-wide change. In recent years, the Company has made \nsignificant progress on many of its global goals and commitments. You can find more information about these initiatives, as well as other \nenvironmental sustainability matters, in our 2022-2023 Purpose & Impact Report and on the \u201cOur Purpose & Impact\u201d section of the \nCompany's website, which is updated periodically as progress and performance updates become available. Information can also be found in \nthe Company's annual Climate Change, Forests and Water reports submitted to CDP, an organization that helps companies manage their \nenvironmental impacts.\nThe Company monitors and manages the evolving environmental landscape to further understand potential risks and opportunities for \nthe business in collaboration with expert partners. The Company believes taking action on environmental matters will drive long-term \nbusiness value by ensuring that it is managing operational costs in its energy supply , improving the security of its raw material supply, \nstewarding the environment in its surrounding communities and reducing its exposure to increasing environmental risks, regulation and \ncosts.\nSUPPLY CHAIN, FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY\nThe Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment, and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The \nCompany has established and enforces high food safety and quality standards and maintains quality center teams around the world \ndesigned to promote consistency of these quality standards and menu compliance. The quality management systems and processes involve \nongoing product reviews, supplier visits and third-party verifications. A Food Safety Advisory Council, comprised of the Company\u2019s internal \nfood safety experts as well as suppliers and outside academics, supports the Company\u2019 s food safety risk management work and provides \nstrategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety and quality . The Company also has ongoing programs to elevate food safety culture \nthroughout the business by educating employees about food safety practices, including proper storage, handling and preparation of food for \ncustomers, and conducting trainings for its suppliers and restaurant operators to share best practices on food safety and quality .\nThe Company collaborates with suppliers to encourage innovation and drive continuous improvement across its global supply chain. \nThe Company also works closely with suppliers and other third-party experts to drive sustainable sourcing initiatives, including the \nenvironmental matters discussed above and improving the health and welfare of the animals within its supply chain. Led by its Global Chief \nSupply Chain Officer, the Company has developed and implemented a comprehensive strategy that its global supply chain organization \nleverages to identify, assess, and manage risk in its supply chain.\nTo reinforce the importance of its values, the Company maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct that applies to all of its suppliers. The \nCompany expects all of its suppliers to meet the rigorous standards set forth in the Code, which cover areas including human rights, \nworkplace environment, business integrity and environmental management. In addition, the Company has a comprehensive Supplier \nWorkplace Accountability (SWA) program to help suppliers understand its expectations, verify compliance and work toward continuous \nimprovement.\nPRODUCTS\nMcDonald\u2019s restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and \ntastes. \nMcDonald\u2019s menu features hamburgers and cheeseburgers, the Big Mac, the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, the Filet-O-Fish, and \nseveral chicken sandwiches like the McChicken, McCrispy and McSpicy , as well as Chicken McNuggets, World Famous Fries, shakes, \nMcFlurry frozen desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, cookies, pies, soft drinks, cof fee, McCaf\u00e9 beverages and other beverages.\nMcDonald\u2019s restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may \ninclude breakfast sandwiches, such as the Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg and McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches, \noatmeal, hash browns, breakfast burritos and hotcakes. \nIn addition to these menu items, restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions.\nTaste, quality, choice, value and nutrition are important to customers, and the Company is continuously evolving its menu to meet its \ncustomers' needs, including testing new products on an ongoing basis.\n \n6McDonald's Corporation 2023 Annual Report    MARKETING\nMcDonald\u2019s global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed with customers in mind and are \nfocused on promoting the McDonald\u2019s brand and differentiating the Company from its competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus \non value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience, cultural relevance and the customer experience. \nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThe Company owns or is licensed to use valuable intellectual property , including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade \nsecrets and other proprietary information. The Company considers the \"McDonald's\" trademark and the Golden Arches Logo to be of \nmaterial importance to its business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are \nused and/or registered. The Company's patents, copyrights and licenses are of varying durations.\nCOMPETITION\nMcDonald\u2019s restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of traditional, fast casual and other food service \ncompetitors. The Company measures its competitive position within the informal eating out (\"IEO\") segment, which is inclusive of the \nCompany's primary competition of quick-service restaurants, but also includes 100% home delivery/takeaway providers, street stalls or \nkiosks, caf\u00e9s, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The Company competes among quick-service \nrestaurants primarily on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety and product quality .\nGOVERNMENT REGULATIONS\nThe Company has global operations and is therefore subject to the laws of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions in which it \noperates and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may dif fer among jurisdictions. As discussed under \u201cLegal \nProceedings \u2013 Government Regulations\u201d on page 35 of this Form 10-K, governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various \naspects of the restaurant business, including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety , environment, competition, zoning, \nemployment and taxation.\nWhile costs associated with legal and regulatory compliance have increased along with the number and scope of laws and regulations \naffecting our business, these costs are not expected to have a material effect on the Company\u2019s capital expenditures, earnings or \ncompetitive position.\n \nMcDonald's Corporation 2023 Annual Report    7"

We now have almost 50 million  \nactive loyalty users in our top six markets.\nto make the right moves to meet the needs of our \ncommunities and ensure enduring, profitable growth \nfor all stakeholders.\nGrowing market share through \ncustomer centricity  \nThe System\u2019s alignment around our Accelerating the \nArches  growth strategy, which we put in place at the \nstart of the pandemic, has put us in an advantageous \nposition. We are growing market share in most of our \nmarkets; the Brand is more relevant to customers \nand stakeholders than it has been in years; and, since \n2020, we\u2019ve achieved an increase in Systemwide \nsales 1  of nearly $20 billion.  \nThat momentum continued through 2022, as global \ncomparable sales grew by almost 11% \u2013 and global \nguest counts grew by 5%. Our success is a direct \nresult of our continued focus on our M, C, D  \ngrowth pillars:\nWe continue to elevate our Marketing (\u201cM\u201d) through \ncreative excellence and by driving programs with \ncultural relevance that can be scaled across markets. \nNot only do our Famous Orders remain hugelyAccelerating the \nArches has put us in an \nadvantageous position\nEarning the right to meet customer \nneeds in new ways  \nIt\u2019s clear that our business plan is working. However, \nas we have throughout our history, we continue  \nto push ourselves to keep our Brand relevant for \nfuture generations. \nWe asked ourselves two questions: Is there \nanything we should add to Accelerating the Arches ? \nAnd is there anything that could get in the way of its \ncontinued success?  \nAnnual Letter to Shareholders1 Consists of both Company and franchised sales\nThe answer to these two questions led us to evolve \nour Accelerating the Arches  strategy to set up a \nstrong foundation for future growth. We\u2019ll continue \nto double down on our M, C, D growth pillars, while \naccelerating the pace of new restaurant openings \nwhere there is increased customer demand, alongside \na diverse base of franchisees to run them. Additionally, \nwe\u2019re implementing Accelerating the Organization to \nmodernize the way we work as a company so that \nwe\u2019re faster, more innovative and more efficient.\nT o drive these critical elements of our evolved \nstrategy, we have created new leadership roles on  \nour global Senior Leadership T eam and appointed \nvalues-based leaders into new roles.  \nMorgan Flatley has been promoted to Executive \nVice President, Global Chief Marketing Officer and \nNew Business Ventures, where she will continue to \noversee our award-winning marketing efforts and \nexpand her scope to lead new business ventures with \nopportunities that extend the reach of the Brand in \nnew ways.  \nSkye Anderson has been elevated to President,  \nGlobal Business Services (GBS). Skye will oversee GBS,  \na new business unit of McDonald\u2019s that will make the \norganization more efficient, make it easier for teams \nto collaborate and free up time for our markets to \nfocus on driving growth in the business.   \nThese appointments were complemented by \nadditional leadership moves: Kevin Ozan to Senior \nExecutive Vice President, Strategic Initiatives; Ian Borden to Executive Vice President, Chief \nFinancial Officer; Marion Gross to Executive Vice \nPresident, Global Chief Supply Chain Officer; and Jo \nSempels to President, International Developmental \nLicensed Markets. \nIn addition to these moves, we were delighted \nfor Jill McDonald to rejoin McDonald\u2019s last year \nas President, International Operated Markets. \nAnd we also welcomed Brian Rice as our new \nExecutive Vice President, Global Chief Information \nOfficer, and Jon Banner as our new Executive Vice \nPresident, Global Chief Impact Officer.\nI am proud to work closely with such a dynamic \nteam that collectively acts as a phenomenal \nsteward of the Brand. Every single leader embodies \nour values and plays a crucial role in driving efforts \nthat propel our growth.   \nTaking meaningful action to advance  \nequity of opportunity  \nBeyond meeting the changing needs of our \ncustomers, Accelerating the Arches  is guiding  \nour efforts to feed and foster communities and \nmake the Golden Arches shine for more people.  \nAs a first job for thousands and a first opportunity \nfor many entrepreneurs to run their own \nbusinesses, we feel a special responsibility to  \noffer even more meaningful opportunities.  \nMeeting customers \nwhere they are\nAnnual Letter to Shareholderschanges. And it\u2019s more important than ever that  \nwe raise our ambition to meet tomorrow\u2019s \nchallenges and make the important decisions  \nthat go with them.\nAs we closed out 2022 and hit the ground running \nin 2023, we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to \nlook forward to \u2013 not just in the year ahead, but in \nthis next great chapter at McDonald\u2019s. Throughout \nthis chapter and beyond, I am confident that we will \ncontinue to deliver sustained, long-term, profitable \ngrowth for our System and shareholders.\nThank you to our shareholders and valued \ncustomers for your continued support; thank you to \nour Board of Directors for their ongoing guidance \nand support; and thank you to the McDonald\u2019s \nSystem for making this another year of which I am \nimmensely proud. In the last year, this included advancing education \nand skill development opportunities. We awarded \nmore than $20 million in tuition assistance, and \naccess to education for more than 10,000 employees \nthrough our Archways to Opportunity  program. \nAdditionally, we launched support for 40 non-\nprofits that provide pre-employment support and \nskills development primarily to Black and Latinx \ncommunities through the new Chicago Community \nImpact Grants  program.\nKey to building a talent pipeline of future leaders \nand expanding opportunity is fostering a culture of \ninclusivity. In 2022, as part of our Allyship through \nAccountability  program, we introduced expectations \nthat hold all Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents \nand Managing Directors accountable for engaging in \ninclusive behaviors that support talent development \nand build a strong, diverse succession pipeline \u2013 \nwith their performance against these expectations \ndirectly contributing to their compensation.\nMoreover, we\u2019ve taken additional steps to champion \nentrepreneurship and generational wealth across \nour System. This is of particular importance as we \nseek to increase our recruitment of first-time owners \nfrom underrepresented groups. Building on our 2021 \ncommitment of $250 million to further diversify our \nfranchisee base, we announced additional steps to \nbring clarity, transparency and consistency to our \nfranchising processes.  \nThese actions advance our efforts to keep equity  \nof opportunity central to our business, while \nensuring that our franchisee base better reflects  \nthe communities we serve.\nRaising the bar for the future\nDuring one of McDonald\u2019s first Worldwide \nConventions, Ray Kroc said: \u201cWe are living in a rapidly \nchanging world, so McDonald\u2019s will change

Our international branches \u2013 Australia,  United Kingdom, United States of America, Thailand, and Vietnam \u2013 registered  25 per/uni00A0cent growth in revenue. \nBroad-based growth achieved across \ngeographies and core strategic sectors such as real estate, energy, infrastructure and technology was enhanced by diversification of sectors and/uni00A0increased engagement with institutional investors including private equity, pension and sovereign wealth  funds on their investments and acquisitions. Continued increase in/uni00A0trade/uni00A0and investment flows across China-ASEAN, underscored our strategic focus on capturing opportunities from/uni00A0Greater China and/uni00A0intra-Asian trade/uni00A0corridors.\nIt was also encouraging to see many \nof/uni00A0our/uni00A0customers across the markets reinforce/uni00A0their commitment to sustainability. This led to even stronger demand/uni00A0for sustainable finance. We achieved over $13 billion in new sustainable finance commitments, bringing our total commitments to $34/uni00A0billion by the end of 2021 \u2013 surpassing our \u2018$25 billion by 2025\u2019 target/uni00A0four years ahead of schedule. We/uni00A0have set a new target to grow our/uni00A0sustainable financing portfolio to $50/uni00A0billion by 2025. \nAs part of our industry-specific \nsustainability efforts, we adopted the Poseidon Principles to track, monitor and drive emissions reduction in our shipping portfolio \u2013 the first bank in Southeast Asia As digitalisation \nand sustainability \ngain momentum globally,  \nwe are focused on integrating \nopportunities in these areas \nby expanding sustainable \n finance coverage throughout \nour network and stepping up \npartnerships in new \neconomy ecosystems.Our Year in Review 52We are also one of the founding shareholders \nof Singapore Trade Data Exchange (SGTraDex), a public-private partnership to develop a common data infrastructure to provide trusted and secure data sharing for/uni00A0stakeholders in the supply chain ecosystems. New use cases are also being/uni00A0developed to support green trade/uni00A0financing. \nAnother example is our partnership with \nGuocoLand and local fintech company Doxa to develop and pilot the built environment industry\u2019s first end-to-end digital workflow solution to streamline and/uni00A0automate all procurement and payments workflow processes for real estate development projects. Given the sheer volume of invoices and number of stakeholders involved across the industry, the digitalisation of the workflow processes will bring cost savings and/uni00A0improved productivity.\nIn the public sector, we supported CPF \nBoard on the launch of the GovCash cheque replacement service in Singapore. This enables Singaporeans who are unable to use direct banking crediting to receive government payments via our ATMs without the need to have a/uni00A0bank account with us. This service leverages the National Digital Identity infrastructure and Singpass face verification to authenticate users. \nWhat opportunities lie ahead? \nAs digitalisation and sustainability gain momentum globally, we are focused on integrating opportunities in these areas by/uni00A0expanding sustainable finance coverage throughout our network and stepping up partnerships in new economy ecosystems. \nWe see much growth opportunities \nin/uni00A0sustainable food and agriculture technology (agri-tech). The pandemic has/uni00A0accelerated the adoption of/uni00A0agri-tech in/uni00A0light of the food supply disruptions fueled/uni00A0by the pandemic. Governments across the region have since/uni00A0been investing/uni00A0in sustainable food and  agri-tech to boost farm productivity and/uni00A0build onshore food security. \nOn this front, we are focused on building \ncollaborative partnerships with stakeholders in the eco-system, such as corporates, government agencies and private equity firms. One such example is our strategic partnership with Proterra Asia \u2013 the Asian arm of Proterra Investment Partners, a global private equity fund manager with investment focus on food and agri-business. The partnership aims to grow and transform the agriculture and food ecosystem in Asia via investment and corporate banking opportunities alongside funds managed by Proterra Asia. \nMobility is another emerging sector that we \nhave identified. Asian markets, such as China and Thailand, where we have presence, are ramping up their investments across the electric vehicle (EV) value-chain. Other than the automotive manufacturers, other sub-sectors such as battery manufacturers, green metals and EV charging solution providers are rapidly developing.\nIn Singapore, we have embarked on a \npartnership with Charge+, an operator and provider of EV charging solutions, to boost their plans of installing 10,000 charging points island wide by 2030. Our goal is to accelerate the \u2018greening\u2019 of the region\u2019s land transport sector in the next decade and help drive the adoption of EVs. \nOur Sustainable Finance \nAchievements in 2021 \n>$13 billion  in new \ncommitments to \nsustainable/uni00A0finance \n2X increase in commitments \nto renewable energy \n>80 green and sustainability-\nlinked loans completed\n>50 green/sustainability \nadvisor roles \n1st bank in \nSoutheast/uni00A0Asia \nto sign on to the Poseidon Principles, to support international shipping\u2019s goal of reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2050\nA memorandum of understanding was signed by Mr Ong Tze Boon, Chairman of Charge+ (2nd from right) and Ms Elaine Lam,  \nHead of Global Corporate Banking, OCBC Bank (2nd from left).

In addition to strengthening the GT digital team, we have also invested in upskilling/reskilling our staff by providing them with training in data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc. We also put many of our colleagues through a structured data programme that the Bank co-designed with Ngee Ann Polytechnic and accredited by the Institute of Banking and Finance, where they learned coding, data visualisation and advanced data analytics through application of scientific methods and data-discovery tools. \nBy continuously enhancing our digital \nproduct capabilities to cater to evolving customer needs, we were able to launch foreign exchange trading, and gold and silver investment products for GCFS customers on the OCBC digital mobile banking app.Kenneth Lai\nHead of Global Treasury\nCentral banks and governments around the world are starting to withdraw Covid-related stimulus. How will that impact the recovery of/uni00A0the global economy? \nIt has been two volatile years due to \nthe/uni00A0Covid-19 pandemic. With policymakers expressing more confidence in recovery and vaccination rates, they have turned their attention to inflation and are starting to withdraw stimulus, an indication that macroeconomic fundamentals will soon be/uni00A0on more solid ground. In the interim, however, financial markets could be in for/uni00A0a/uni00A0challenging time as they enter \u201cnon-crisis mode\u201d and navigate interest rate trajectories and fiscal policy recalibrations, including taxes.Last year,  \nGlobal Treasury achieved \nanother record year in net \nprofit after tax. Despite the \nuncertainties posed by \nthe ongoing pandemic,  \nwe adjusted well to the  \nnew working order and \ncapitalised on market \nopportunities. \nCentral banks and governments will be sure to closely monitor the Covid situation and calibrate their policies to support the/uni00A0economy and employment. These are expected to be measured as the economy remains challenged by virus-related risks, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, risks of stagflation and growing uneven income distribution. \nOn the bright side, as economic activities \ngain ground once again, we look forward to/uni00A0customers increasing their investment  and hedging activities, in addition to new/uni00A0growth opportunities from OCBC\u2019s continuing investment in accelerating digital transformation and growing the/uni00A0greenfield sustainability linked product/uni00A0solutions.\nHow did Global Treasury (GT) \nperform in 2021?\nLast year, GT achieved another record year in \nnet profit after tax, with strong momentum sustained for customer sales across regions. This was the third consecutive year of growth. In particular, NPAT grew 25% last year compared to pre-pandemic 2019. Despite Our Year in Review 54What are your targets and  \nkey focus areas for 2022?\nWe intend to build upon our financial \nmarket product development in technology and quantitative capabilities to continue delivering value for customers. We aim to connect customers electronically to/uni00A0provide price discovery and ease of execution, especially with new customers in the digital commerce business. We are also looking to/uni00A0offer Global Treasury products in/uni00A0token forms such as fractionalised bonds/uni00A0to/uni00A0allow customers to buy in smaller denominations and into basket ideas. On the sustainability front, we will continue to/uni00A0build our ESG product capabilities, and look to offer customers ESG products for hedging and/uni00A0investments.\nManaging risk remains a key area for Global \nTreasury. With risks of rising rates and yields, we will continue to be tactical in our portfolio management. In addition to/uni00A0Covid-19, we will maintain an active watch on the various possible risks that could arise from regulatory and political developments, and selected industries and/uni00A0geography. \nWe will also continue to focus on private \nequity and private debt for a suitable investor base, structured investments and/uni00A0growing the institutional business regionally whilst collaborating with internal stakeholders to grow our wallet share of customer business.\nSustainability initiatives are going \nto be a huge driving force for major/uni00A0corporation and countries around the world. How has GT/uni00A0incorporated sustainability into/uni00A0its/uni00A0products and work?\nSustainability is no longer an option but \nan/uni00A0imperative. 2021\u2019s COP26 impressed the/uni00A0importance of collective action. But while governments are the ones setting the targets, the bulk of the heavy lifting must fall upon companies. For society as a/uni00A0whole to reach net-zero, most companies will need to decarbonise by a minimum of 90 to 95 per cent across their value chains, according to the Science Based Targets initiative. Global Treasury can influence and shape the actions of our colleagues and clients with our sustainability product and solutions offerings to help them achieve their goals. For example, we introduced Singapore\u2019s first sustainability-linked structured deposit, first sustainability-linked SGD step-down interest rate swap, as well as the first sustainability-linked EUR/SGD cross-currency swap. These product solutions, which link customers\u2019 financing terms to their ability to generate positive outcomes, can go a long way in incentivising them to meet their sustainability goals. We/uni00A0will be expanding our offerings to meet customers\u2019 rising demand for such products. \nWe also publish ESG reports to educate both \ncolleagues and clients on topics including carbon trading, hydrogen, and biofuels. In/uni00A0doing so, we provide the tools and knowledge to foster responsible investing. \nWe are moving into an endemic \nsituation with Covid-19. Can you reflect on what this means for yourself and your business?\nThe past two years of living with Covid-19 \nhas greatly shaped the way we operate today. Amid the trend of hybrid workplace arrangements, accelerating digitalisation and the rise of e-commerce, Global Treasury has adapted well to the new normal. As we expect more customers to adopt a hybrid model, we will continue to improve and transform our customers\u2019 user experience, digitalising the process for product purchases and getting access to self-help financial analysis, all while maintaining a personal touch and engaging with customers whenever we can.Awards\nFX House of the Year, \nSingapore\nawarded by FX Markets \nAsia/uni00A0Awards\nBest Derivatives House \nin/uni00A0Southeast Asia: Flow, Equity, Rates, Credit, FX/uni00A0&/uni00A0Commodities\nawarded by Alpha \nSoutheast/uni00A0Asia \nBest Corporate Treasury \nSales & Structuring Team, Singapore\nawarded by Alpha \nSoutheast/uni00A0Asia\nBest FX Bank for \nCorporates & FIs, Singapore\nawarded by Alpha \nSoutheast/uni00A0Asia\nBest FX Bank for \nInterest Rates, FX/uni00A0Research and Market/uni00A0Coverage, Singapore\nawarded by Alpha \nSoutheast/uni00A0Asia\nBest FX Bank for CCS, \nIRS,/uni00A0Forward & Options Hedging (Corporates, FIs/uni00A0&/uni00A0SMEs), Singapore\nawarded by Alpha \nSoutheast/uni00A0AsiaHead of Sales & Structuring for Global Treasury Wee/uni00A0Wei Min \nwith our FX House of the Year trophy, an/uni00A0award we won for the/uni00A0second year in a row.\nOCBC Annual Report 2021 55Mr Jason Ho\nHead of Group Human Resources\nUpfront with \nJasoninformation on the vaccination through \nonline webinars with medical experts.

It was so/uni00A0well-received that we have decided to/uni00A0make this an annual event, since wellness/uni00A0lays the groundwork for building/uni00A0confidence and capabilities, and/uni00A0we want/uni00A0to continue investing in and/uni00A0maximising employee potential.\nWhen we made work from home (WFH) \nthe default at the height of the pandemic, our leaders and people managers stepped up and reached out to/uni00A0our employees to make sure they were/uni00A0doing well. It was heartening to see/uni00A0everyone in the organisation proactively finding new ways to ensure that we remained connected and/uni00A0engaged. \nHow can HR add value to business?\nWe add value by shaping our culture  and championing organisational transformation which enables and empowers our people to become effective leaders. By supporting our employees through targeted and personalised initiatives, programmes and policies,  they can continue to create and deliver value to the Group and the business.\nCreating and sustaining a strong \norganisational culture is at the core of what we do. Such a culture cannot be built/uni00A0overnight. We have intentionally and/uni00A0carefully nurtured this over time. Our/uni00A0leaders have always been advocates of/uni00A0developing our employees by maintaining a learning culture. This culture inspires our/uni00A0employees to attain their full potential professionally and personally. Through the/uni00A0pandemic and beyond, we remain steadfast in our vision of being guided by/uni00A0the right culture and mindset. We continue to empower our employees to/uni00A0learn, re-skill and up-skill to remain relevant. This helps us deepen talent bench/uni00A0strength for current and/uni00A0future/uni00A0roles.

A strong learning culture  is the foundation for sustained people development and business growth. The OCBC Group Learning Blueprint is the  first ever artefact of our learning culture, reflecting the state of learning, the collective aspirations of our people and codifying the principles of learning to perpetuate our strong learning culture.\nCentral to building a strong learning \norganisation is our support of autonomous learning. We provide a plethora of learning opportunities for everyone, create content from the ground-up and refresh policies and processes to promote a strong learning organisation. We have enhanced the programmes on our learning platform on both desktop and mobile to make learning accessible to all employees. Over the last three years, we have updated the learning infrastructure, policies and processes  at the OCBC Group to further strengthen the foundation of our strong learning culture. All we do is to empower our employees to take ownership of their professional and personal development. Their success is our success. \nThrough our OCBC Future Smart \nProgramme, we will continue to invest in/uni00A0upskilling and reskilling all our employees globally.

What is your HR strategy for developing people?\nOur philosophy for workforce development \nis that everyone is a leader and has an/uni00A0inherent capacity to lead. We offer a/uni00A0comprehensive suite of talent development programmes catering to employees at all levels, from entry hires to/uni00A0senior hires. \nThrough programmes such as the OCBC \nGraduate Talent Programme, OCBC/uni00A0NTU Executive Development Programme, LEAD/uni00A0(a three-month programme to build/uni00A0key competencies such as leading courageously, adaptability and strategic thinking in our VPs), OCBC/uni00A0INSEAD Executive Development Programme and/uni00A0BOLD (a group-wide senior/uni00A0leadership programme which provides experienced leaders with insights and perspectives on/uni00A0global issues affecting corporations and/uni00A0countries), we develop our people holistically with an eye towards honing leadership skills that/uni00A0are all-encompassing.\nThe demand for talent will intensify. \nHence, to grow the local talent pool and instil leadership capabilities in the/uni00A0early stages of education, we have designed and/uni00A0introduced programmes such/uni00A0as the/uni00A0OCBC FRANKpreneurship programme, STEM@OCBC internship, HEYA student ambassador programme and/uni00A0OCBC Ignite./uni00A0Through these programmes, we/uni00A0support undergraduates by providing opportunities for them to obtain knowledge and skills that can be applied in their future/uni00A0careers and to gain insights into the/uni00A0work culture and career prospects in/uni00A0the banking industry. These programmes help us establish an early working relationship with undergraduates before they enter the/uni00A0workforce full time. \nTo empower our staff to lead and mentor \nothers, we developed MentorMe. This is a/uni00A0bank-wide mentoring initiative for/uni00A0 early- to mid-career women where we  help them build intentional relationships with experienced mentors in an organic learning community within the Bank.\nWe also facilitate internal job mobility and \ncontinuous learning to help individuals succeed. Through programmes such as the/uni00A0Internal Job Programme which gives employees first crack at available positions,/uni00A0 and Xplore which allows employees to explore short-term job stints within or across divisions, we empower our people by enabling them to take charge of their own careers, broadening their experience in different functions and locations, and pursuing long-term career/uni00A0growth with the Bank.\nBeing recognised for doing what is right  \nfor our people and the organisation inspires us to do more and we will  continue to fulfil our commitment of investing in and taking care of our people.\nWhat will the focus be for HR as we \ntransition into a post-pandemic future?\nThe pandemic has changed behaviours  \nand preferences of not just our customers, but also our employees. We will continue to shape and enhance employee experience by listening to our employees and considering their feedback when developing policies and programmes to support their work. We/uni00A0developed the Employee Experience Blueprint from dialogues between employees and managers to achieve better alignment between the organisation\u2019s vision and employee priorities. Taking inspiration from the Employee Experience Blueprint, we aim to transform \u201cmoments that matter\u201d into \u201cjourneys that matter\u201d by outlining operational processes across functions and/uni00A0making improvements as needed.\nThrough the pandemic, we adopted a \nhybrid/uni00A0model of work, providing flexible working arrangements to our employees. This flexible work arrangement which takes into/uni00A0consideration employees\u2019 roles and responsibilities, inputs from their managers, as well as operational, security/uni00A0and regulatory risks requirements, will continue even after the/uni00A0pandemic. Flexible work arrangements which have been in/uni00A0place before the pandemic, such as/uni00A0working part-time, and/uni00A0starting/ending at/uni00A0an earlier/later time, will continue. We/uni00A0will also continue to inculcate/uni00A0our culture of emphasising communication and trust between managers and employees.\nHarnessing the power of technology, our \nexpanded HR services are made available via our in-house employee app\u2014HR In My Pocket (HIP)\u2014to serve our people/uni00A0better. On top of being able to select benefits, file/uni00A0claims, apply for leave, view internal job/uni00A0opportunities and staff promotions, and retrieve a whole range of/uni00A0information, our employees can now access their employee share purchase plan portfolio, book meeting rooms or complete their learning tasks on the go using the app. Tapping into our people data and insights, we will continue to focus on delivering superior employee experience to/uni00A0our people.\nTo realise our ambition of being a \nleading/uni00A0regional bank, we must ensure the/uni00A0organisation and our employees have/uni00A0the right capabilities. We have put/uni00A0in/uni00A0place structured learning and mobility roadmaps, enabling our talents to/uni00A0experience short-term stints within  the regions the Group has presence.

In which areas of the strategy \nhave you seen the most progress?\nAs the name of the strategy suggests, \nit\u00a0is about growing OCBC sustainably \nand achieving excellence in the way \nwe\u00a0operate and run the business. The \nemphasis here is on \u2018long-term\u2019. OCBC \nhas navigated various crises and \nchallenging times. We have always \nemerged stronger.\nTapping on our collective strength as \nOCBC Group is important. By building \non\u00a0our comprehensive regional \nfranchise\u00a0under \u201cOne Group\u201d, we \nexpect\u00a0collaboration across various \nproducts and business groups to play \na\u00a0bigger role in driving income.\nWe have made some structural changes \nto our franchise in Hong Kong. Since \nOCBC Bank acquired Wing Hang Bank \nin\u00a02014, Hong Kong branch and the \nrenamed OCBC Wing Hang remained \nseparate entities. In December 2021, \nwe\u00a0reached a significant milestone with \nthe integrated platform of Hong Kong \nbranch and OCBC Wing Hang. Doing so \nenabled us to use our talent, capital, \nliquidity and other resources more \nefficiently and effectively. We can also \nscope business opportunities better and \nsupport a full spectrum of customers \nwith the strength of one consolidated \nHong Kong team. \u201cWe celebrated our 90th \nanniversary in 2022 \u2013 \na milestone for OCBC.  \nI am confident that, \nguided by our values \nand strong management, \nwe will thrive for another \n90 years and beyond.\u201d\n24Our investments in digitalisation have \nshown good results too. In Singapore, \n98% of SME accounts and practically all \nof our consumer accounts are opened \ndigitally. 96% of consumer financial \ntransactions are done online and 90% \nof\u00a0business financial transactions are \nconducted digitally. We made progress \nin the new economy and high-growth \nindustries spaces too. For instance, we \nlaunched embedded finance propositions \non five platforms in Singapore, Malaysia \nand Indonesia, thereby enabling small \nand medium-sized enterprises to access \nfinancing more efficiently.\n2022 was a significant year for OCBC in \nthe area of sustainability. I will talk more \nabout it later in this section.\nWhat are you most optimistic \nabout\u00a0for 2023, and what are some \nof your\u00a0concerns?\n2023 will hopefully be the year where we \ncan put Covid firmly in our rear-view \nmirror. China\u2019s faster-than-expected \nreopening and policy stimulus has made \nthis more of a possibility, barring any \nsetbacks. Trade and investment flows \nbetween Greater China and ASEAN will \npick up as a result and we expect wealth \nflows to increase as well. \nThe groundwork that we have \nconscientiously and consistently been \nworking on has put us in a good position \nto seize these opportunities. We are \nalready seeing the fruits of our labour.\nIn the area of Wealth Management, \nwe\u00a0will continue strengthening our hub \ncapabilities across Singapore, Hong \nKong, Dubai and London and enlarge \nBank of Singapore\u2019s dedicated Family \nOffice Advisory Unit. We will also expand \nour offshore OCBC Premier Private Client \nand OCBC Premier Banking propositions \nin key Asian markets.Achievements\nGroup net profit rose 18%  \nto a record high of $5.75 billion\n$25 billion  net new \nmoney inflows across Bank of \nSingapore and OCBC wealth \nmanagement franchise\nBecame a signatory to the \nNet-Zero Banking Alliance  \nAchieved carbon neutrality  \nfor banking operational \nemissions in 2022\nTop 10 Strongest Banks \nin\u00a0Asia Pacific\nAwarded by The Asian BankerThis change was foundational for us \ngiven the importance of Hong Kong. \nTogether with Singapore as the nexus \nof\u00a0ASEAN, and Hong Kong as the \ngateway to Greater China, we have \nsuccessfully captured the increasing \nASEAN-Greater China trade and \ninvestment flows.\nSuch flows often result from the China \nPlus One strategy adopted by corporates \nincluding China State-Owned \nEnterprises (SOEs) and companies. They \nwant to establish an additional \nmanufacturing base in ASEAN to \ncomplement their China operations and \nbuild resilience, especially in the wake \nof global supply chain disruptions. By \ntapping on different business units\u2019 \nexpertise and our presence in different \nmarkets, we can offer them the breadth \nof products and services that they need, \nfrom lending to treasury, foreign \nexchange, and cash management. To \nfurther facilitate the capture of these \nflows, we\u00a0have expanded our Greater \nChina Business Office network last year, \nadding Indonesia to our existing offices \nin Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.\nWe have also fared well in leveraging \nour twin wealth hubs and digital \npropositions to capture rising Asia \nwealth flows. Even though 2022 was \nchallenging for wealth management \nin\u00a0general, we attracted net new \nmoney\u00a0inflows. \nWe continued to improve on our Group \nWealth Platform \u2013 a collaboration \nbetween OCBC Bank and Bank of \nSingapore \u2013 for our high net worth \nand\u00a0ultra-high net worth customers to \nprovide superior advisory and unified \ninvestment views on one platform. In \nFebruary 2022, OCBC Wing Hang China \nand OCBC Wing Hang Macau jointly \nlaunched the Northbound Wealth \nManagement Connect Service to \nprovide more diversified investment \nopportunities and richer asset \nallocation\u00a0options.\nOCBC Annual Report 2022\n25\n Upfront with HelenPartnerships can assist in developing a better understanding of sustainability. Together with the National University of Singapore, we embarked on a study on how to best nudge Singaporeans \ntowards the adoption of electric vehicles. (L-R) Ms Helen Wong, Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Associate Professor Alberto Salvo from the Department of \nEconomics at the NUS Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences launched this partnership at OCBC Centre in August 2022.\nOf course, 2023 will have its challenges. \nThe volatility that we saw in 2022 has \ncarried into 2023. This could be the \nstory\u00a0for the entire first half of the year, \nalthough we do believe that it will ease \nin the second half. The volatility \nmay\u00a0create headwinds for Wealth \nManagement but our diversified \nbusiness, with the three pillars of \nBanking, Wealth Management and \nInsurance, provides stability, whatever \nthe season. \nOur reshaped balance sheet allowed us \nto capture the benefits from the series \nof\u00a0rate hikes by the Fed in 2022 as seen \nin increases in net interest income and \nnet interest margins. In 2023, we must \nonce again be well-prepared \u2013 but this \ntime, with an eye on interest rates \ncoming down.The bank has made big strides in its \nenvironmental sustainability efforts. \nWhat is next?\n2022 was significant for us. We achieved \ncarbon neutrality for our operational \nemissions through key carbon reduction \nmeasures such as space optimisation \nand adopting innovative cooling \ntechnologies, while supporting carbon \noffset projects in the region. We also \nexpanded our carbon sequestration \nefforts through two mangrove restoration \nprojects in 2022 \u2013 the OCBC Mangrove \nPark in Singapore and another project in \nTebuk Mendeleng, Malaysia.\nIn addition, we became the second \nSingapore bank to join the United \nNations-convened, industry-led Net-Zero \nBanking Alliance. This reflects our \ncommitment to achieving net-zero not \njust in our operations but also in our \nlending and investments businesses. \nThe\u00a0next step to this would be to unveil \nour sectoral financed emission targets, \nwhich we will do by the first half of 2023.While we are working on formalising \nthese targets, we are already supporting \nour customers in their transitions to \nnet-zero with utmost urgency. This is \nreflected in the continued expansion \nof our sustainable finance commitments \nwhich currently stands at $44 billion. \nAt\u00a0this rate, we are likely to reach our \n$50\u00a0billion target ahead of our \n2025\u00a0schedule.\nGiven the urgency of the climate \nagenda,\u00a0we are constantly looking for \nnew ways to support the movement. \nLast year, we launched the OCBC \nSustainability Innovation Challenge. \nOur\u00a0inaugural partner on this challenge \nwas our corporate customer SATS, \nand\u00a0working together, we were able \nto\u00a0conduct a worldwide search for \nsolutions\u00a0to waste management and \nreduction challenges. We will continue \nthis challenge with other likeminded \ncustomers from key industries and \nalso find other partnership \nopportunities.\n26Volunteers from OCBC Malaysia planting a mangrove tree at Tebuk Mendeleng, Malaysia.90 Years and Beyond\nWe commemorated our 90th anniversary by launching two mangrove restoration \nprojects in 2022: OCBC Mangrove Park at Pulau Ubin in Singapore and Tebuk \nMendeleng in Malaysia. 18,000 mangrove trees are expected to take root by 2026. \nThese trees can absorb more than 30 million kg of CO 2 in their lifetimes and protect \nshorelines against erosion and storm surges. These gifts to the community are in \nline with the theme \u201c90 years of giving\u201d and show how our LIFRR values are \ntranslated into action.\nI have summarised steward leadership \nfor sustainability in 4Cs:\n\u2022 Commit: We will commit to making \npolicy and process changes and invest \nin people development. \n\u2022 Collaborate: Collaboration must \nflourish in our interactions with other \norganisations and the community. \n\u2022 Catalyse: We must play a catalytic \nrole\u00a0by enabling and encouraging the \ntransition towards decarbonisation. \n\u2022 Courage: Oftentimes, someone just \nneeds to tip the first domino and set \nthings in motion. We have done that \nin the past. We were the first bank \nin\u00a0Southeast Asia to say we would \nstop\u00a0funding new coal-fired power \nplants\u00a0and to announce a target for \nsustainable finance. Bank of Singapore \nwas the first in Asia to incorporate \nESG\u00a0factors in assessing investment \nfunding. We will continue to play this \nleadership role.\nWhat is your management \nphilosophy and vision for your \nleadership team?\nTo me, it is very important to lead \u2013 \nand\u00a0live \u2013 by the OCBC corporate values: \nLasting Value, Integrity, Forward-looking, \nRespect and Responsibility. LIFRR, as we \ncall it, is an important part of our culture. \nIt is the foundation for everything we do. \nThat is true not just for the leadership \nteam, but also everyone in the Group.\nBeing future-oriented is especially \nimportant and this has been the impetus \nfor a lot of what I have done since \nbecoming CEO two years ago. In an \nincreasingly competitive landscape, \nthere is an urgency to collaborate even \nbetter as One Group. We\u00a0institutionalised this regionally with \nan enhanced reporting structure at the \nend of 2021 and continued to build on it \nin 2022. New teams like our Group Data \nOffice and the Global Wholesale Banking \nSustainability Office were also formed \nas\u00a0part of an organisation refresh. \nWith the retirement of some of our \nsenior leaders, there have been new \nmembers joining our senior leadership \nteam. These additions came from both our internal talent base as well as \nexternal hires. Together, we have the \nright mix of experience and perspectives \nin the senior leadership team to be able \nto deliver on our Corporate Strategy and \ndrive sustainable growth. \nWe celebrated our 90th anniversary \nlast\u00a0year \u2013 a milestone for OCBC. I am \nconfident that, guided by our values and \nstrong management, we will thrive for \nanother 90 years and beyond.\nOCBC Annual Report 2022\n27\n Upfront with Helen\u201cI will strengthen our \ncapital management \nand optimise the utilisation \nof capital resources. This \nwill allow us to deliver \nlong-term shareholder \nvalue, while leaving us \nwith sufficient room to \ndrive franchise growth and \nto explore opportunities \nfor inorganic growth as \nthey arise.\u201d\nHaving assumed the role of Group \nCFO in November 2022, what is your \nvision for Group Finance?\nMy immediate focus is to take stock of \nGroup Finance as a whole and work out \nhow we can play an effective strategic \nrole in our refreshed Corporate Strategy \nto Excel for Sustainable Growth. There \nare three focal areas of priority.\nFirstly, I would like to look at how \nGroup\u00a0Finance can reinforce our \nstrengths, especially in our business \nanalytics capabilities to better provide \nbusiness insights and advisory to our \ncolleagues across the bank. This is an \nimportant enabler to drive more efficient \nresource allocations (including people, \ntechnology and capital), and support all \neight pillars of our Corporate Strategy \nto\u00a0drive growth.\nSecondly, I will strengthen our capital \nmanagement and optimise the \nutilisation of capital resources. This \nwill\u00a0allow us to deliver long-term \nshareholder value, while leaving us \nwith\u00a0sufficient room to drive franchise \ngrowth and to explore opportunities \nfor\u00a0inorganic growth as they arise.Upfront with\nChin Yee\nGroup Chief Financial Officer\n28Achievements\nRecord net profit of\n$5.75 billion\nReturn on equity improved to \n11.1%  from 9.6% in 2021\nEarnings per share at \n$1.27 , up 18% from 2021\nTotal dividend raised to \n68\u00a0cents , at 53% dividend \npayout ratio\nStrong capital position with \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital \nAdequacy Ratio of 15.2%Last but not least, building up our \npeople\u00a0assets is important. That, of \ncourse, includes developing individual \ntalents. But to really support our \nCorporate Strategy\u2019s \u201cOne Group\u201d \napproach, we need to first reinforce \ncollaboration within our Division by \nfinding ways to optimise our collective \ntalents as \u201cOne Group Finance\u201d. By \ndoing\u00a0so, we can better scale our \nexpertise and foster innovation to be \nan\u00a0enabler for the Group in achieving \nour\u00a0Corporate Strategy.\nOCBC reported record profits in \n2022. How can this momentum \nbe\u00a0sustained?\nWe were able to manage the challenges \nof 2022 well in part because we have a \ndiversified business comprising banking, \nwealth management and insurance. In \nparticular, our well-positioned balance \nsheet has enabled us to benefit from the \nrapid rise in interest rates. Our results \nhave been propelled by strong growth \nin\u00a0net interest income, underpinned by \nasset growth and net interest margin \nexpansion. Lower allowances from \nimproving credit conditions and sound \nportfolio quality also lifted our earnings. \nThese more than compensated for \nslower investment-related fee income \namidst volatile and uncertain market \nconditions. Overall, while customer \ninvestment activity was more subdued, \nwe were still able to attract and grow \nnet new money inflows into our wealth \nmanagement franchise. That is a very \npositive sign.\nOur geographical diversification continued \nto be a plus for us as well. It is one of the \nkey enablers for us to pursue growth in \nchallenging and uncertain climates. \nThough we are headquartered in \nSingapore, a substantial proportion of \nour income comes from our key overseas \nmarkets like Greater China, Malaysia \nand\u00a0Indonesia. In the immediate future, as we continue \nto reshape our balance sheet, we are \nthinking about how we can consistently \nperform well even when interest rates \nare dropping. Ensuring the resilience of \nour portfolio quality so that we do not \nend up with high impairment charges \nis\u00a0also foremost in our minds. This is \nespecially so given the inflationary \npressures and possibility of recessions \nin\u00a0certain markets.\nHowever, we are not just thinking about \nour next immediate steps, but planning \nfor the medium to long-term too. While \ndoing so, it is important to exercise \nefficient resource allocations and be able \nto reap benefits from our investments, \nand Group Finance plays a vital role in \nproviding insights and advisory.\nWhat impact will our net-zero \ncommitment have on our business?\nSustainability is often seen as a balancing \nact and indeed, sometimes doing the \nright thing might come at the expense \nof short-term profits. But ultimately, we \nbelieve that organisations should choose \nto do good, and that we can still achieve \nconsistently good returns by doing so.\nInvestors are now seeing sustainability \nas a must-have, not just good to have, \nand are focusing more on companies \nwith responsible business practices. \nApart from investors, rating agencies \nare\u00a0also paying close attention. They \nare\u00a0increasing their due diligence on \nour\u00a0sustainability practices as part of \ntheir rating assessments for banks. We \nmaintain regular communication with \nthe rating agencies as well as with our \ninvestment community, to provide \nupdates on our efforts and progress. \nAs\u00a0a\u00a0result, we were included on the \ninaugural Steward Leadership 25 list \nand\u00a0the FTSE4Good Index. Our net-zero \ncommitment, and other efforts in the \nrealm of sustainability, are vital \nto\u00a0position us well for the future. \nUpfront with Chin Yee\nOCBC Annual Report 2022 29\n\u201cThe exchange of insights \nand information between \nbusinesses and academia \nhas long been valued \nby us and we want to \nembark on more of such \ncollaborations to pioneer \nnew innovations that will \nbenefit our customers \nand the community.\u201d\nWhat did the Bank achieve on the \ndigitalisation and transformation front?\nWe continue to double down on our \ndigitalisation and transformation efforts \nto drive operational and business \nexcellence. \n2022 marked the completion of Phase 1 of \nour seven-year digital core roadmap which \ncommenced in 2019. Over $250 million \nwas invested in the period (2019 \u2013 2022) \nto refresh our key channel systems across \nour markets to enable quicker roll-out of \ndigital features and sharpening of our \npersonalisation capabilities with artificial \nintelligence and machine learning. \nTime-to-market for new digital features \nhas been cut dramatically, allowing new \nreleases to be introduced twice as quickly. \nAn example was the use of digital passport \nauthentication for foreign SME owners to \nopen accounts with us, eliminating the \nneed for cumbersome paper documents. \nThere has also been a significant uptake \nin sales through the deployment of \npersonalisation capabilities. \nWe continue to explore opportunities \nin\u00a0the digital asset space to benefit our \ncustomers, employees and the broader \ncommunity. In conjunction with the \nBank\u2019s 90th anniversary celebrations \nand\u00a0to raise awareness of such assets \namong our staff, we minted our first \nNon-Fungible Token (NFT) which was Upfront with\nKhiang Tong\nGroup Chief Operating Officer\n30given to staff to commemorate the \nspecial occasion. The NFT was minted \non our in-house blockchain platform. \nOn the operational excellence front, \nwe\u00a0have streamlined close to 150 \nprocesses in the second half of 2022. \nSuch improvements not only speed up \nour response to our customers\u2019 needs \nbut also optimise the internal workflows \nand drive better working experience for \nour colleagues. \nBuilding our data and analytics capabilities \nremains a key focus as well. More than \n7,000 staff completed the \u2018Lead with \nData\u2019 training programme in 2022 and \nwe will further tap on data to make \ndecisions and unlock insights. \nWhat is the progress on the \noperational decarbonisation front?\nI am glad that we achieved carbon \nneutrality in our operational emissions \nin 2022. In pursuing this target annually, \nnot just in 2022, we are guided by the \nprinciple of reducing our global carbon \nfootprint as much as possible before \noffsetting the residual and unavoidable \nemissions through the purchase of \ncarbon credits. \nWe announced in May last year that \nmore than $25 million will be invested \nin decarbonisation efforts in Singapore, \nMalaysia and Greater China. The \ninvestments will be used to deploy \nenergy-efficient technology to reduce \nour carbon emissions, and solar energy \nsystems that will increase renewables in \nour energy mix for powering operations. \nThese investments will yield \napproximately a reduction of 10,000 \ntonnes of carbon emissions by 2025. \nThis is equivalent to removing close to \n10,000 cars from the road. \nOther initiatives in our decarbonisation \nroadmap include converting our fleet \nof corporate cars to electric vehicles \nand deploying electric vehicle charging \nfacilities at major commercial buildings \nwe manage. In March 2022, 10 charging \npoints were installed at OCBC Centre \n\u2013 making it the largest electric vehicle \ncharging hub in the central business \ndistrict in Singapore.

The investments \nwill go into improving areas such as the \nfacilitation of payments and loans that \nwill improve turnaround time.\nTo intensify our transformation, we \nhave\u00a0been and will continue to build \nour\u00a0workforce capabilities. Our tech \nworkforce doubled from 2018 to 2023 \nand there are plans to hire another \n1,500\u00a0tech talents by 2025. \nStrategic partnerships is another area \nthat we will continue to harness to \ndeliver greater value for our customers \nand employees. Last year, we signed \na\u00a0five-year partnership with NTU \nSingapore to develop innovative \ntechnological solutions in areas such \nas\u00a0data privacy and cyber security.\nThe exchange of insights and information \nbetween businesses and academia has \nlong been valued by us and we want to \nembark on more of such collaborations \nto pioneer new innovations that will \nbenefit our customers and the community. \nOCBC Annual Report 2022\n31\n Upfront with Khiang Tong\u201cWe are resilient and  \nwell-positioned to \nnavigate the challenging \nrisk landscape and capture \nnew opportunities to excel \nfor sustainable growth.\u201d\nUpfront with\nNoel\nGroup Chief Risk OfficerHow did the Bank navigate \nthrough\u00a0the risk and credit portfolio \nchallenges of 2022? How is 2023 \ngoing to look like? \n2022 had its own share of challenges, \nwith the withdrawal of Covid restrictions \nin many economies offset by multiple \nheadwinds and event risks. Pent-up \ndemand as economic activities returned, \nsupply bottlenecks caused by Russian-\nUkraine war and labour shortages, for \ninstance, led to sharp spikes in inflation. \nCentral banks responded with several \nrounds of interest rate increases, sharply \nraising borrowing costs. Other challenges \nincluded China\u2019s rolling Covid lockdown \nand property malaise, as well as \nescalating geopolitical and economic \ntensions with the US.\nIn the face of this, we managed our \nrisks\u00a0well and our portfolio quality has \nremained resilient. We proactively \nassessed the vulnerability of our credit \nportfolio from emerging headwinds and \nevent risks via thematic and portfolio \nreviews and stress tests. Appropriate \nand\u00a0timely actions were then taken \nto\u00a0manage potentially vulnerable \nborrowers and portfolios identified. We \ngrew our portfolio cautiously through \ncareful client selection and tightening of \nunderwriting criteria for sectors-at-risk. \nWe also increased hedges in our bond \nportfolios to manage the sharp \ncorrections in major financial markets. \nIn 2023, headwinds from the polycrisis \nare expected to continue. The \nmacroeconomic environment remains \nuncertain and financial markets volatile. \n32"

CSI is calculated as the average of customer satisfaction scores from email surveys.\nBrand preference (%)\n13.8 2021: 14.2\nBrand Share Preference is the percentage of customers who answer 'Shell' in\u00a0response to the question: \"Assuming that all the fuel station companies that you would consider are conveniently located, which ONE company do you prefer most?\". Responses are taken from survey respondents in more than 60\u00a0countries covering both fuel and non-fuel retail B2C customers.\n Safety\n Personal safety \n(SIF-F cases per 100 million working hours)\n1.7 2021: 6.9\nSerious Injury, Illness and Fatality (SIF) is defined as a serious work-related \ninjury or illness that resulted in fatality or a life-altering event, which is defined\u00a0as a long-term or permanent injury or illness with significant impact\u00a0on daily activities. Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F) is\u00a0calculated by dividing the number of employee and contractor SIF by\u00a0100\u00a0million working hours.\nSee \"Safety\" on page 121 . \n Process safety (number of events)\n66 2021: 103 [A]\nA Tier 1 process safety event is an unplanned or uncontrolled release of any \nmaterial, including non-toxic and non-flammable materials, from a process with the greatest actual consequence resulting in harm to employees, contract staff, or a neighbouring community, damage to equipment, or exceeding a threshold quantity, as defined by the API Recommended Practice 754 and IOGP Standard 456.

With non-controlling \ninterest included, income for the period in 2022 was $42,874 million, compared with $20,630 million in 2021. After current cost\u00a0of supplies adjustment, total segment earnings in 2022 were\u00a0$41,562 million, compared with $17,482 million in 2021.\nEarnings on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings) exclude the \neffect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts, after making allowance for the tax effect. The purchase price of volumes sold in the period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period, rather than on the historic cost calculated on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. When oil prices are decreasing, CCS earnings are likely to be higher than earnings calculated on a FIFO basis and, when prices are increasing, CCS earnings are likely to be lower than earnings calculated on a FIFO basis. Integrated Gas earnings in 2022 were $22,212 million, compared with\u00a0$8,060 million in 2021. The increase was mainly driven by the combined effect of higher realised prices and contributions from trading and optimisation, and gains related to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives. This was partly offset by lower volumes and higher operating expenses.\n \nSee \"Integrated Gas\" on pages\u00a038-43 . \nUpstream earnings in 2022 were $16,222 million, compared with $9,603 million in 2021. The increase was mainly driven by higher realised prices, gains relating to storage and working gas transfer effects and impairment reversals. This was partly offset by lower volumes, mainly as a result of divestments, and charges relating to\u00a0the\u00a0EU solidarity contribution and UK Energy Profits Levy.\nSee\u00a0\"Upstream\" on pages 44-51 . \nStrategic Report | Progress on strategy \u2013 year in review\nGenerating shareholder value\n29 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n 29\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2022Marketing earnings in 2022 were $2,133 million, compared with \n$3,535 million in 2021. The decrease was mainly driven by higher operating expenses (including the effects of higher volumes), net losses on the sale of assets compared with net gains in 2021, and higher impairment charges. These were partly offset by higher margins.\n \nSee \"Marketing\" on pages 60-64 . \nChemicals and Products earnings in 2022 were $4,515 million, compared with $404 million in 2021. The increase was mainly driven by higher Products margins (reflecting higher Refining margins and higher contributions from trading and optimisation), and lower impairment charges. These were partly offset by lower Chemicals margins and higher operating expenses.\n \nSee \"Chemicals and Products\" on pages 65-72.\nRenewables and Energy Solutions earnings in 2022 were a loss of $1,059 million, compared with a loss of $1,514 million in 2021. The decrease in the loss was mainly driven by higher contributions from trading and optimisation  for gas and power. This was partly offset \nby\u00a0higher net losses related to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and higher operating expenses.\n \nSee \"Renewables and Energy Solutions\" on pages 73-76.\nCorporate segment earnings in 2022 were an expense of \n$2,461\u00a0million, compared with an expense of $2,606 million in 2021. \nThe lower expense was mainly driven by favourable movements in net\u00a0interest expense.

Management applies Shell's cash to support disciplined capital expenditure and maintain a resilient balance sheet; target AA credit metrics through the cycle; deliver a\u00a0progressive dividend to shareholders with growth of around 4% annually (subject to Board approval); and target total  distributions \nto\u00a0shareholders of a minimum of 20% and (subject to Board approval and prevailing market conditions) potentially more than 30% of our cash flow from operati ng activities.\nThe Board may choose to return cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. When setting the level of shareholder remuneration, the Board looks at a range of factors, including the macro environment, the underlying business earnings and cash flow of the Group, the current balance sheet, future investment, acquisition and divestment plans, and existing commitments.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nShell generated cash flow from operations of $68.4  billion, including \na\u00a0negative impact from working capital of $5.4 billion, and free cash flow of $46.0 billion in 2022, aided by the improving global macro enviro nment for oil and gas businesses, and divestments (for more \ninformation on free cash flow see \"Non-GAAP measures reconciliations\" on pages 362-365). Net debt decreased to $44.8 billion at December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: $52.6 billion). Gearing fell to 18.9% at December 31, 2022, compared with 23.1% at \nDecember 31, 2021, as higher income increased equity and cash flow generation reduced net debt. Note 20 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on pages 279-280 provides information on our debt arrangements, including net debt and gearing definitions.\nLiquidity\nWe satisfy our funding and working capital requirements from the cash generated from our operations, the issuance of debt and divestments. In 2022, access to the international debt capital markets remained strong, with\u00a0our debt principally financed from these markets through central debt programmes consisting of: \u25aaa $10 billion global commercial paper (CP) programme, with maturities between 183 days and 364 days;\n\u25aaa $10 billion US CP programme, with maturities not exceeding 397\u00a0days;\n\u25aaan unlimited Euro medium-term note (EMTN) programme (also referred to as the Multi-Currency Debt Securities Programme); and\n\u25aaan unlimited US universal shelf (US shelf) registration. \nThe CP, EMTN and US shelf debt is issued by Shell International Finance B.V., the issuance company for Shell, with its debt being guaranteed by Shell plc (the Company). \nWe also maintain committed credit facilities. The core facilities \nwere\u00a0extended in December 2022. Of the $9.92 billion total facility, $1.92\u00a0billion matures in 2023, $0.32 billion in 2025 and $7.68 billion \nin 2026. This remained fully undrawn at December 31, 2022. These\u00a0core facilities and internally available liquidity  provide back-up \ncoverage for our CP programmes. Other than certain borrowing by local subsidiaries, we do not have any other committed credit facilities. Our total debt decreased by $5.3 billion to $83.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The total debt excluding leases matures as follows: 8% in\u00a02023; 8% in 2024; 11% in 2025; 7% in 2026; and 66% in 2027 and beyond. The portion of debt maturing in 2023 is expected to be\u00a0repaid from some combination of cash balances, cash generated \nfrom operations, divestments and the issuance of new debt.\nIn 2022, we did not issue any bonds under our US shelf registration \nor\u00a0EMTN programme. $175 million of CP was issued in the second quarter, and repaid within the same quarter. CP outstanding was zero at\u00a0the end of 2022. Management believes it has access to sufficient debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable requirements.\nWhile our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions, such as foreign \nwithholding taxes on the transfer of funds in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, such restrictions are not expected to have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations. \nMarket risk and credit risk\nWe are affected by the global macroeconomic environment, as well as financial and commodity market conditions. This exposes us to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity risk, credit risk, and market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk). See\u00a0\"Risk factors\" on page 22 and Note 25 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on pages 293-299. The size and scope of our businesses require a robust financial control framework and effective management of our various risk exposures. \nWe use various financial instruments for managing exposure to \ncommodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements. Our\u00a0treasury and trading operations are highly centralised and seek to\u00a0manage credit exposures associated with our substantial cash, commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate positions. Our portfolio of cash investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any one\u00a0instrument, country or counterparty. The use of external derivative instruments is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that have appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems. Credit risk policies are in place to ensure\u00a0that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness, and include credit analysis and monitoring of customers against counterparty credit limits. Where appropriate, netting arrangements, credit insurance, prepayments and collateral are\u00a0used to manage credit risk.\nPension commitments\nWe have substantial pension commitments, the funding of which is subject to capital market risks (see \"Risk factors\" on page 23). We \naddress key pension risks in a number of ways. Principal among these is the Pensions Forum, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, which oversees Shell\u2019s input to pension strategy, policy and operation. A risk committee supports the forum in reviewing the results of assurance processes in respect of pensions risks. In general, local trustees manage the funded defined benefit pension plans, with contributions paid based on independent actuarial valuations in accordance with local regulations. Our total employer contributions were $0.7 billion in 2022 and are estimated to be $0.8 billion in\u00a02023.\n \nSee Note\u00a023 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on pages 285-291.\nStrategic Report | Progress on strategy \u2013 year in review\nGenerating shareholder value\n31 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n 31\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2022 Capitalisation table\n $ million\nDecember \n31, 2022December \n31, 2021\nEquity attributable to Shell plc shareholders  190,472  171,966 \nCurrent debt  9,001  8,218 \nNon-current debt  74,794  80,868 \nTotal debt [A]  83,795  89,086 \nTotal capitalisation  274,267  261,052 \n[A]Of total debt of $83.8 billion (2021: $89.1\u00a0billion), $55.2 billion (2021: $61.5 billion) was \nunsecured and $28.6 billion (2021: $27.6\u00a0billion) was secured. $51.0 billion was issued \nby Shell International Finance B.V., a 100%-owned subsidiary of Shell plc with its debt guaranteed by Shell plc (December 31, 2021: $54.7 billion). See Note 20 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on pages\u00a0 279-280  for further disclosure on debt.\nGuarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements\nThere were no guarantees or other off-balance sheet arrangements at\u00a0December 31, 2022, or December 31, 2021, that were reasonably likely to have a material effect on Shell. \nStatement of cash flows\nCash flow from operating activities in 2022 was an inflow of $68.4\u00a0billion, compared with $45.1 billion in 2021, mainly due to\u00a0higher earnings, partly offset by unfavourable working capital movements of $5.4 billion (compared with unfavourable working capital movements of $10.4 billion in 2021). The increase in cash flow\u00a0from operating activities in 2021, compared with $34.1  billion \nin\u00a02020, was mainly due to higher earnings, partly offset by unfavourable working capital movements.\nCash flow from investing activities in 2022 was an outflow of \n$22.4\u00a0billion, compared with an outflow of $4.8 billion in 2021. The\u00a0increased cash outflow was mainly due to lower proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment in 2022. The decreased cash outflow in 2021 compared with $13.3 billion in 2020 was mainly due to higher proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment in 2021,\u00a0including\u00a0the divestment of our Permian assets in the USA.\nCash flow from financing activitie s in 2022 was an outflow of \n$42.0\u00a0billion, compared with outflows of $34.7 billion in 2021 \nand\u00a0$7.2\u00a0billion in 2020, mainly due to higher repurchases of \nshares\u00a0of\u00a0$18.4 billion (2021: $2.9 billion; 2020: $1.7 billion) and\u00a0net\u00a0repayment of debt of $7.9\u00a0billion (2021: $19.7 billion net\u00a0repayment; 2020: $5.6\u00a0billion net issuance). \nCash and cash equivalents were $40.2 billion at December 31, 2022 \n(December 31, 2021: $37.0 billion; December 31, 2020: $31.8 billion).\n \nSee Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 241.\nCash flow from operating activitiesThe most significant factors affecting our cash flow from operating activities are earnings, which are mainly impacted by: realised prices for crude oil, natural gas and LNG; production levels of crude oil, natural gas and LNG; chemicals, refining and marketing margins; and\u00a0movements in working capita and derivative financial instruments. \nThe impact on earnings from changes in market prices depends \non:\u00a0the\u00a0extent to which contractual arrangements are tied to market prices;\u00a0the dynamics of production-sharing contracts; the existence of agreements with governments or state-owned oil and gas companies that have limited sensitivity to crude oil and natural gas prices; tax impacts; and\u00a0the extent to which changes in commodity prices flow through into\u00a0operating expenses. Changes in benchmark prices of crude oil and natural gas in any particular period provide only a broad indicator of changes in our Integrated Gas and Upstream earnings in that period. Changes in any one of a range of factors, derived from either within the industry or the broader economic environment, can influence refining and marketing margins. The precise impact of any such changes depends on how the oil markets respond to them. The market response is affected by factors such as: whether the change affects all crude oil types or only a specific grade; regional and global crude oil and refined products inventories; and the collective speed of\u00a0response of refiners and product marketers in adjusting their operations. As a result, margins fluctuate from region to region and\u00a0from period to period.\nDivestment and cash capital expenditure\nThe levels of divestment proceeds and cash capital expenditure in 2022 and 2021 reflect our discipline and focus on the Powering Progress strategy. Divestment proceeds for 2022 were $2.1 billion, compared with $15.1  billion in 2021, which included the divestment \nof\u00a0the Permian assets.\nCash capital expenditure is used to monitor investing activities \non\u00a0a\u00a0cash basis, excluding items such as lease additions which do\u00a0not\u00a0necessarily result\u00a0in cash outflows in the period.\n Cash capital expenditure\n $ million\n2022 2021 2020\nIntegrated Gas  4,265  3,502  3,566 \nUpstream  8,143  6,168  7,099 \nMarketing  4,831  2,273  1,774 \nChemicals and Products  3,838  5,175  4,198 \nRenewables and Energy Solutions  3,469  2,359  928 \nCorporate  287  221  262 \nTotal cash capital expenditure  24,833  19,698  17,827 \n See non-GAAP measures reconciliations on pages 362-365.\nStrategic Report | Progress on strategy \u2013 year in review\nGenerating shareholder value | Financial framework continued\n32 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n 32\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2022Contractual obligations\nThe table below summarises our principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2022, by expected settlement period.

Debt contractual obligations exclude interest, which is estimated to be $1.7 billion payable in less than one year, \n$3.0\u00a0billion between one and three years, $2.5 billion between three and five years, and $14.8\u00a0billion in five years and later. For this purpose, we assume that interest rates with respect to \nvariable interest rate debt remain constant at the rates in effect at December 31, 2022, and that there is no change in the aggregate principal amount of debt other than repayment at scheduled maturity as reflected in the table. Lease contractual obligations include interest.\n[B]Purchase obligations disclosed in the above table exclude commodity purchase obligations that are not fixed or determinable and are principally intended to be resold in a short period of time through sale agreements with third parties. Examples include long-term non-cancellable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refined products or crude oil at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in measuring liquidity and cash flow, as the cash outflows generated by these purchases will generally be offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions.\n[C]Includes obligations included in \"Trade and other payables\" and provisions related to onerous contracts included in \"Decommissioning and other provisions\" in \"Non-current liabilities\" in the \"Consolidated Balance Sheet\" that are contractually fixed as to timing and amount. In addition to these amounts, Shell has certain obligations that are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount, including contributions to defined benefit pension plans (see Note\u00a023 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on pages 285-291 ) and obligations associated with \ndecommissioning and restoration (see Note\u00a024 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on page 292-293 ). \nDividends\nSubject to Board approval, Shell aims to grow the dividend per share by around 4% every year. In total, Shell targets the distribution of a minimum of 20% and, subject to Board approval and prevailing market conditions, potentially more than 30% of our cash flow from operations to shareholders. Shell may choose to return cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.\nWhen setting the level of shareholder distributions, the Board looks at \na\u00a0range of factors, including the macro environment, the earnings and cash flows of the Group, the current balance sheet, future investment, \nacquisition and divestment plans  and existing commitments. We \nreturned $7.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends in 2022. \nThe fourth quarter 2022 dividend of $0.2875 per share will be paid\non March 27, 2023, to shareholders on the register at February 17, 2023, and represents an increase of 15% compared with the third quarter of 2022.\n \nSee Note 29 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on page 303.\nPurchases of securitiesOn February 3, 2022, share buybacks of $8.5 billion for the firsthalf of 2022 were announced, comp rising  two programmes which \nwere completed in May 2022 and July 2022. These included the remaining $5.5 billion of the Permian divestment proceeds that had been allocated for share buybacks. On July 28, 2022, and October 27, 2022, the Company announced buy backs  of $6 billion and\n$4 billion which were completed in October 2022 and January2023 respectively, leading to a total of $18.4 billion across 2022.The buyback s were conducted on both London market exchanges\nand Amsterdam exchanges.Between January 1, 2022, and January 28, 2022, 32 million B shares were purchased and cancelled. Over the remainder of 2022, 650 million ordinary shares were purchased and cancelled. Overall,a total nominal share value of \u20ac48 million ($57 million), 9.8% of the \nCompany's total issued share capital at December 31, 2022, was purchased and cancelled during 2022 for a total cost of $18.4 billion, including expenses, at an average price of $26.99 per share.\nThe buybacks completed in the first half of 2022 were in accordance \nwith the authorities granted by shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM). The buybacks completed in the second half\u00a0of 2022 were in accordance with the authorities granted by shareholders at the 2022 AGM. At the 2022 AGM, authority was granted for the Company to repurchase up to a maximum of 10% of its issued ordinary shares, excluding treasury shares, (758 million ordinary shares), both on and off market, allowing purchases on Amsterdam as well as London exchanges. As at December 31, 2022, 416 million \nordinary shares could still be repurchased under the current AGM authorit ies. The purpose of the share repurchases in 2022 was to \nreduce the issued share capital of the Company.\nNew resolutions will be proposed at the 2023 AGM to renew the \nauthority for the Company to purchase its own share  capital , up to \nspecified limits, for a further year. These proposals will be described in\u00a0more detail in the 2023 Notice of Annual General Meeting.\nShares are also purchased by the employee share ownership \ntrusts\u00a0and\u00a0trust-like entities (see Note 27 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on page 300) to meet delivery commitments under employee share plans. All share purchases are made inopen-market transactions. \nThe table on the next page provides information on purchases of shares \nin 2022 and January 2023 by the Company and affiliated purchasers.

See \"Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust Financial Statements\" on pages 352-356. Certain condensed\nfinancial information in respect of the Trust is given below. \nThe Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited and BG Group \nLimited have each issued a dividend access share to Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited (the Trustee). For the years 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Trust recorded income before tax of \u00a3nil, \u00a32.2 billion, and \u00a32.8 billion respectively. In each period, this reflected the amount of\u00a0dividends payable on the dividend access shares. Dividends are\u00a0also\u00a0classified as unclaimed where amounts have not cleared recipient bank accounts.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Trust had total equity of \u00a3nil (December 31, \n2021: \u00a3nil; December 31, 2020: \u00a3nil), reflecting assets of \u00a36 million (December 31, 2021: \u00a37 million; December 31, 2020: \u00a37 million) and unclaimed dividends of \u00a36 million (December 31, 2021: \u00a37 million; December 31, 2020: \u00a37 million). The Trust only records a liability for an\u00a0unclaimed dividend to the extent that dividend cheque payments have not been presented within 12 months, have expired or have been\u00a0returned unpresented. On January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through assimilation of each A share and each B share into one ordinary share of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or dividend entitlements. Dutch withholding tax, applied previously on dividends on A shares, no longer applies on dividends paid on the ordinary shares following the assimilation.\nIn relation to the assimilation of the Company's A and B shares, the \nTrust will continue in existence for the foreseeable future to facilitate the\u00a0payment of unclaimed dividend liabilities for shareholders of the former B shares until these are either claimed or forfeited in line with the\u00a0terms outlined.Strategic Report | Progress on strategy \u2013 year in review\nGenerating shareholder value | Financial framework continued\n34 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n 34\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2022Market overview\nIn 2022, the energy price shock and rising food prices led to a cost-of-\nliving crisis and lower economic growth, pushing up inflation to levels not seen for many decades. \nPrices were already creeping up as a result of the economic rebound \nfrom the pandemic, its lockdowns and related supply chain constraints. But inflation soared globally after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered the war that continues today. \nShell maintains  a large business portfolio across an integrated value \nchain and is exposed to fluctuating prices of crude oil, natural gas, \noil\u00a0products, chemicals and power (see \"Risk factors\" on page 15). \nThis\u00a0diversified portfolio provides resilience when prices are volatile. Our annual planning cycle and periodic portfolio reviews aim to ensure\u00a0that our levels of capital investment and operating expenses are\u00a0appropriate in the context of a volatile price environment. \nWe test the resilience of our projects and other opportunities against \na\u00a0range of prices  for crude oil, natural gas, oil products, chemicals \nand\u00a0power. We also aim to maintain a strong balance sheet to \nprovide\u00a0resilience against weak market prices.\nGlobal economic growth\nHigher energy and food prices have caused real wages to fall in many\u00a0countries, slashing purchasing power. This is hurting consumers. In addition, central banks around the world are increasing interest rates to curb inflation and anchor inflation expectations in their economies. Tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates, weak real household income growth and declining confidence have resulted in lower economic growth during 2022. \nFor 2023, a further growth slowdown for the world economy is \nprojected, as well as high, but declining, inflation in many countries. In\u00a0the International Monetary Fund's latest global economic prospects report published in January 2023, global growth is forecast to decelerate from 6.2% in 2021 and 3.4% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2023. Asia is expected to be the main engine of growth in 2023 and 2024,whereas Europe, North America and South America are expectedto see very low growth. \nRisks to the economic outlook remain significant, including new \nuncertainties about natural gas supplies to Europe, the impact ofthe real estate and COVID-19 crises in China, and a resurgence of COVID-19 health scares around the world. Central banks must charta difficult path as they face mixed economic signals, such as slowing economic growth with still-tight labour markets and strong pressure for \nwage growth. In this environment, an insufficient increase in interest rates may prove a mistake. If rates are not adequately raised, inflation could become entrenched, prompting higher interest rates in the future at a significant cost to the economy. On the other hand, increasing interest rates by too much may risk sending many economies intodebt distress and prolonged recession.Global prices, demand and supplyThe following table provides an overview of the main crude oil and natural gas price markers to which we are exposed:\n Oil and gas average industry prices [A]\n 2022 2021 2020\nBrent ($/b)  101  71  42 \nWest Texas Intermediate ($/b)  95  68  39 \nHenry Hub ($/MMBtu)  6.4  4.0  2.0 \nEU TTF ($/MMBtu)  40  16  3 \nJapan Customs-cleared Crude ($/b) - 3 months  98  60  51 \n[A]Yearly average prices are based on monthly average spot prices. The 2022 average price \nfor Japan Customs-cleared Crude is based on available market information up to the end of the period.\nCrude oil and oil products \nThe global benchmark oil price Brent averaged $101 per barre l (/b) in \n2022, the highest annual average price since 2013. This represents an increase of more than 40% increase from the annual average of $71 /b \nrecorded in 2021. High prices were mostly realised in the first half of the year, with demand recovering as economies reopened and supply constrained by the capacity of major oil producers. Russia's invasion of\u00a0Ukraine triggered concerns about supply availability, sending Brent \nto a high of $133/b on March 8, 2022. Prices stayed at an elevated level until the middle of the year, before falling as recession concerns weighed on the market. Brent averaged $80/b in December, the same price as it was in the fourth quarter of 2021. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at a sharper discount of around $6/b to Brent in 2022, compared with a discount of about $3/b in 2021. This is because of rising demand for Brent as a replacement for Urals, the most common grade of Russian crude exports. \nIn 2022, global oil product demand rose by more than 2 mb/d to \nnearly 100 mb/d, approaching the pre-COVID-19 level of 100.5 mb/d in 2019. Growth largely came from jet fuel, supported by the rebound in air travel after the pandemic. Growth in other product segments continued in 2022, albeit at a slower pace. Global diesel/gas oil growth eased from 1.5 mb/d in 2021 to 0.66 mb/d in 2022 based on\u00a0IEA estimates, reflecting weakening economic activities. Naphtha, after a strong year of growth in 2021, declined by 0.13 mb/d due to\u00a0a\u00a0weak petrochemical sector. Regionally, growth has largely come\u00a0from non-OECD markets, particularly the Middle  East and \nIndia.\u00a0Chinese demand dropped by about 0.4 mb/d as lockdowns \nin\u00a0the country affected demand. Among OECD markets, Europe an \ngrowth was particularly weak. While high gas prices resulted in a switch from gas to oil, this was largely offset by a weak petrochemical sector which struggled with high energy costs. \nGlobal oil production increased to 100 million b/d in 2022, up by\n4.7 mb/d from 2021. Growth was largely led by the ramp-up of Saudi Arabia n and US shale oil. Saudi Arabia delivered an additional 1.4 \nmb/d compared with 2021, about half of the OPEC supply growth. Outside OPEC, the USA added 1.2 mb/d, providing about 60% of the non-OPEC growth. During the third quarter, there were concerns about whether OPEC would raise production in step with demand recovery because a number of member countries were producing below quota. But the trend started shifting from the fourth quarter, with OPEC in November reintroducin g production cut s of 2 mb/d, in view of the \npotential surplus should economic conditions worsen. Strategic Report | Progress on strategy \u2013 year in review\nGenerating shareholder value\n35 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n 35\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2022Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has strong ramifications for global crude \nand oil product supply. Before the invasion, Russian production was expected to surge by more than 0.8 mb/d in 2022, according to the IEA. But actual production growth was about 0.2 mb/d due to OECD market sanctioning. Global crude/product trade flow also shifted as Russian crude/products were redirected to non-OECD markets. \nThe outlook for 2023 demand is highly uncertain. One key uncertainty \nis the recession risk in OECD economies, particularly Europe. China's lifting of COVID-19 restrictions to focus on economic growth could provide some support to global oil demand. The main uncertainty on the supply side is the supply from Russia after the embargo on Russian crude and oil products took effect. The EU embargo and G7 price caps\u00a0on Russian crude oil took effect in early December 2022. Russian oil\u00a0product embargoes and price caps followed in February 2023. These measures could lead to a further reduction in Russia's oil supply.\nNatural gas\nGlobal demand for natural gas in 2022 is estimated to have declined by 1.6% compared with 2021. This was a result of high, volatile prices and shorter supply, particularly in Europe and emerging Asia n \ncountries, which led to reduced industrial, commercial and residential consumption. The year-on-year downturn came after gas demand rebounded in 2021 from the historically low levels during the pandemic. Europe\u2019s gas market experienced an unprecedented supply shock from the sharp reduction in Russian pipeline gas imports. Already-elevated spot gas prices in Europe rose further under the threat of Russian supply curtailments and the uncertainty about the LNG market\u2019s ability to make up the difference. This triggered demand curtailment in Europe's industrial sector. It also caused a slowdown in LNG import purchases in China amid economic weakness and COVID-19 lockdowns. Emerging economies, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, struggled with the affordability of spot LNG.\nEuropean gas prices were turbulent in 2022 as almost all pipeline \nflows from Russia came to a halt. Exports through Gazprom\u2019s pipelines fell from a 2022 peak of just over 300 million cubic metres per day \n(mcm/d) to about 65 mcm/d in November. On an annual basis, Europe\u2019s imports of Russian pipeline gas almost halved. The Europe an \nbenchmark price Title Transfer Facility (TTF) was volatile, breaching $96/MMBtu at its peak. There were also large disconnection s in \nregional European gas hub prices caused by the reconfiguration of supply flows and regasification capacity reaching maximum utilisation rates. This particularly affected the UK\u2019s National Balancing Point (NBP) and TTF prices, as well as the price of delivered LNG.\nThe pricing environment was a catalyst for major demand destruction. \nThe residential and commercial consumer sector shed more than 15% \nof\u00a0demand year-on-year, assisted by mild temperatures. The industrial sector is estimated to have lost more demand year-on-year t han any \nperiod for over a decade. But TTF prices experienced a sharp decline \nat the end of the third quarter after Russian gas pipeline cuts materialised  and gas inventories were built beyond government-\nmandated levels ahead of time. Europe remained the highest-priced global gas market for 2022 and attracted substantial volumes away from other markets, especially in Asia. Higher LNG exports into Europe, coupled with demand curtailment, made up for the lack of Russian pipeline imports, allowing for a comfortable storage situation by the\u00a0start of the northern hemisphere winter. European LNG imports \nincreased by about 45 million tonnes with north-west Europe accounting for more than 30 million tonnes of this growth. A migration of floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) to Europe reduced bottlenecks and increased import capacity, specifically to north-west Europe. The commissioning of the Eemshaven FSRU in the Netherlands in September 2022, and the commissioning of several FSRUs for Germany have set Europe up to be a major LNG importer for years\u00a0to\u00a0come. Asian spot LNG prices, as reflected by the Japan Korea Marker (JKM), traded at a significant discount to European prices for most of 2022, driven largely by lower LNG imports into China. By the end of the year, China had imported about 15 million tonnes less LNG year-on-year, ceding the title of the world's biggest LNG importer back to Japan. South Korea and Japan continued to import LNG despite the high spot prices because of JKM buyers\u2019 high concentration of long-term LNG contract volume. Crude-oil-linked contracts were cheaper than JKM prices by an average of 50% in 2022. This was evidenced by the Japan Landed Cost (JLC), which accounts for imported LNG long-term contract and spot prices averaging about $17/MMBtu versus an average of around $33/MMBtu for the spot price of JKM. \nHenry Hub gas benchmark  prices in North America were volatile \nthroughout the year, ranging from below $4/MMbtu to nearly $10/\nMMbtu. Henry Hub cash prices averaged $6.39/MMBtu in 2022, reaching a peak of $9.84/MMBtu in August. The rise in the first half of\u00a0the year was caused by a structurally tighter market and spill-over effects from the higher prices for LNG exports. The decline towards the\u00a0end of the year was a result of strong production and comfortable storage expectations for the northern hemisphere winter. US LNG export plants consumed an average of 11.81 bcf (billion cubic feet) per day throughout the year, accounting for 12% of US overall production of around 97 bcf per day. T his is a 547% increase from five years ago \nand a 203% increase from the previous five-year average. Strong power demand for gas in the USA  and lagging upstream production \nsupported the rise.\nPower\nEurope: European power prices were turbulent in 2022. In Germany, for example, the average power price in 2022 was $247/MWh, an\u00a0unprecedented seven times higher than the average price of$37/MWh in the period from 2015 to 2019. Prices increased in the\u00a0first quarter  of the year, peaking in August with spot prices of \nup\u00a0to\u00a0$916/MWh. European power prices are strongly influenced by\u00a0the power plants dependent on natural gas. Widespread unplanned outages of French nuclear power plants and low hydropower availability also pushed up power prices. The high European power prices have triggered a range of regulatory actions, including revenue caps for inframarginal power generators (generators which do not set marginal prices); national demand reduction goals; \nand a consultation for market reforms by the European Commission. \nUnited States: US power prices were much higher across all major \nmarkets in 2022 compared with 2021. One of the key drivers of higher power prices and volatility in 2022 was gas prices. Henry Hub gas benchmark prices in North America were volatile throughout the year, ranging from below $4/MMbtu to nearly $10/MMbtu. Prices in the second half of the year traded back down to below $4.00/MMBtu as natural gas production steadily increased and the ability to increase storage injections prior to winter picked up. Power prices were also driven higher by weather events throughout the year and across the country. For the eastern part of the USA, cold weather in January led \nISO-NE (New England) prices to average around $150/MWh, and a late December cold front led to significantly higher prices in PJM  and \nMISO (Midcontinent) markets. For the ERCOT (Texas) market, a hot July in Texas led to record level demand and North Hub settled at $147/MWh. A heatwave in the western part of the USA in September sent Mid-C (Midcontinent) ISO and CAISO (California) prices to  highs \nof $152/MWh and $118/MWh respectively, and a cold December resulted in even higher prices in Mid-C ($263/MWh) and CAISO ($254/MWh).

The cash flow from operating \nactivities in 2023 was primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA, and \nworking capital inflow of $7.8  billion (compared with working capital \noutflow of $5.4  billion in 2022), partly offset by tax payments of \n$13.7 \u00a0billion (compared with tax payments of $ 13.1 billion in 2022), \nand derivatives outflow of $6.1\u00a0billion (compared with derivatives inflow of $0.6 billion in 2022).\nCash flow from investing activities in 2023 was an outflow of \n$17.7 \u00a0billion, compared with an outflow of $ 22.4  billion in 2022. \nThe\u00a0cash flow from investing activities in 2023 included cash capital expenditure* of $24.4\u00a0billion (compared with cash capital expenditure of $24.8 billion in 2022), divestment proceeds* of $ 3.1\u00a0billion \n(compared with divestment proceeds of $2.1  billion in 2022), interest \nreceived of $2.1 billion (compared with interest received of $0.9 billion in 2022), and net other investing cash inflows of $1.4 billion (compared with net other investing cash outflows of $0.6 billion in 2022) .\nCash flow from financing activities in 2023 was an outflow of $38.2 \u00a0billion, compared with outflows of $ 42.0  billion in 2022, mainly \ndue to lower repurchases of shares\u00a0of\u00a0$14.6  billion (2022: $ 18.4 \nbillion) and Derivative financial instruments favourable movement of $0.7  billion (2022: $ 1.8 billion unfavourable movement), partly\u00a0offset \nby\u00a0higher\u00a0net\u00a0repayment of debt of $9.8\u00a0billion (2022: $7.9 billion net\u00a0repayment). \nCash and cash equivalents were $38.8  billion at December 31, \n2023\u00a0(December 31, 2022: $ 40.2  billion).\nPrior year Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nOur Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2021, can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 241) and Form 20-F (page 219) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively. \nSee \"Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\" on page 248.\n* Non-GAAP measure (see page 365).Cash flow from operating activitiesThe most significant factors affecting our cash flow from operating activities are earnings, which are mainly impacted by: realised prices for crude oil, natural gas and LNG; production levels of crude oil, natural gas and LNG; chemicals, refining and marketing margins; and\u00a0movements in working capital and derivative financial instruments. \nThe impact on earnings from changes in market prices depends \non:\u00a0the\u00a0extent to which contractual arrangements are tied to market prices;\u00a0the dynamics of production-sharing contracts; the existence of agreements with governments or state-owned oil and gas companies that have limited sensitivity to crude oil and natural gas prices; tax impacts; and\u00a0the extent to which changes in commodity prices flow through into\u00a0operating expenses. Changes in benchmark prices of crude oil and natural gas in any particular period provide only a broad indicator of changes in our Integrated Gas and Upstream earnings in\u00a0that period. Changes in any factors, from within the industry or the \nbroader economic environment, can influence refining and marketing margins. The precise impact of any changes depends on how the oil markets respond to them. The market response is affected by factors \nsuch as: whether the change affects all crude oil types or only a specific grade; regional and global crude oil and refined products inventories; and the collective speed of\u00a0response of refiners and product marketers in adjusting their operations. As a result, margins fluctuate from region to region and\u00a0from period to period.\nDivestment and cash capital expenditure\nThe levels of divestment proceeds and cash capital expenditure in 2023 and 2022 reflect our discipline and focus as we implement our\u00a0Powering Progress strategy. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and businesses were $ 2.6 billion for 2023, compared \nwith $1.4  billion in 2022 and divestment proceeds* for 2023 were \n$3.1 billion,  compared with $2.1 billion in 2022.

The amounts presented \nhave not been offset by any committed third-party revenue in relation to these obligations.\nContractual obligations\n$ billion\nLess than 1 \nyearBetween\n1 and 3 yearsBetween\n3 and 5 years5 years\nand later Total\nDebt [A]  5.4  10.4  8.3  30.4  54.4 \nLeases 6.2  9.5  6.6  16.8  39.1 \nPurchase obligations [B]  33.1  28.1  14.0  59.6  134.8 \nOther long-term contractual liabilities [C]  0.1  0.9  0.1  0.5  1.7 \nTotal  44.7  49.0  29.1  107.2  230.0 \n[A]See Note\u00a020 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\". Debt contractual obligations exclude interest, which is estimated to be $1.6 billion payable in less than one year, $2.7\u00a0billion \nbetween one and three years, $2.4 billion between three and five years, and $13.4\u00a0billion in five years and later. For this purpose, we assume that interest rates with respect to variable interest rate debt remain constant at the rates in effect at December 31, 2023, and that there is no change in the aggregate principal amount of debt other than repayment at scheduled maturity as reflected in the table. Lease contractual obligations include interest.\n[B]Purchase obligations disclosed in the above table exclude commodity purchase obligations that are not fixed or determinable and are principally intended to be resold in a short period of time through sale agreements with third parties. Examples include long-term non-cancellable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refined products or crude oil at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in measuring liquidity and cash flow, as the cash outflows generated by these purchases will generally be offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions.\n[C]Includes obligations included in \"Trade and other payables\" and provisions related to onerous contracts included in \"Decommissioning and other provisions\" in \"Non-current liabilities\" in the \"Consolidated Balance Sheet\" that are contractually fixed as to timing and amount. In addition to these amounts, Shell has certain obligations that are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount, including contributions to defined benefit pension plans (see Note\u00a023 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\") and obligations associated with decommissioning and restoration (see Note\u00a024 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\").\nDividends\nSubject to Board approval, Shell aims to grow the dividend per share \u00a0by around 4% every year. In total, Shell targets  the distribution \nof\u00a030--40% of our cash flow from operations through the cycle to shareholders. Shell may choose to return cash to shareholders through\u00a0a combination of dividends and share buybacks.\nWhen setting the level of shareholder distributions, the Board looks at \na\u00a0range of factors, including the macro environment, the earnings and cash flows of the Group, the current balance sheet, future investment, acquisition and divestment plans and existing commitments. We returned $8.4  billion to our shareholders through dividends and \n$14.6 \u00a0billion through share buybacks  in 2023. Total shareholder \ndistribution s represented 42% of cash flow from operating activitie s*. \nThe fourth quarter 202 3 dividend of $0.344 per share will be paid\non March 25, 2024, to shareholders on the register at February 16, \n2024, and represents an increase of 4% compared with the third quarter of 2023.\nSee Note 29 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" on page 312.\nPurchases of securitiesThe intent to purchase shares was announced alongside the quarterly results during 2023, and covered the period up until the next quarterly announcement. In 2023 , share buybacks of $4 billion were announced \non February 2, $4 billion on May 4, $3 billion on July 27 and $3.5\u00a0billion on November 2 (finalised in the first quarter of 2024). In\u00a0addition, on February 1, 2024, a further buyback  of $3.5 billion \nwas\u00a0announced along with the fourth quarter 2023 results; it is intended that this will be completed by the announcement dateof the first quarter 2024 results.\n* Non-GAAP measure (see page 365).During 2023, 479.4 million ordinary shares were purchased and\u00a0cancelled. Overall, a total nominal share value of \u20ac34 million ($40\u00a0million), 6.8% of the Company's total issued share capital at December 31, 2022, was purchased and cancelled during 2023 for a\u00a0total cost of $14.6 billion, including expenses, at an average price of\u00a0$30.43 per share.\nThe buybacks completed in the first half of 2023 were in accordance \nwith the authorities granted by shareholders at the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM). The buybacks completed in the second half\u00a0of 2023 were in accordance with the authorities granted by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. At the 2023 AGM, authority was granted for the Company to repurchase up to a maximum of 10% of its issued ordinary shares, excluding treasury shares, (692 million ordinary shares), both on and off market, allowing purchases on Amsterdam as well as London exchanges.  As at December 31, 2\n023, 512 million \nordinary shares could still be repurchased under the current AGM authorities. The purpose of the share repurchases in 2023 was to reduce the issued share capital of the Company.\nNew resolutions will be proposed at the 2024 AGM to renew the \nauthority for the Company to purchase its own share capital, up to specified limits, for a further year. These proposals will be described in\u00a0more detail in the 2024 Notice of Annual General Meeting.\nShares are also purchased by the employee share ownership \ntrusts\u00a0and\u00a0trust-like entities (see Note 27 to the \"Consolidated Financial\u00a0Statements\" on page 309) to meet delivery commitments under employee share plans. All share purchases are made inopen-market transactions. \nThe table on the next page provides information on purchases of shares \nin 2023 and January 2024 by the Company and affiliated purchasers. Purchases in euros and sterling are converted into dollars using the exchange rate on each transaction date.Strategic Report | Performance in the year\nGenerating shareholder value | Financial framework continued\n36 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n 36\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2023Purchases of equity securities by issuer and affiliated purchasers in 2023 [A]\nEuro Shares GBP Shares ADSs [B]\nPurchase periodNumber\npurchased\nfor employee\nshare plansNumber\npurchased\nfor cancellation \n[C]Weighted\naverage\nprice\u00a0($)[D]Number\npurchased\nfor employee\nshare plansNumber \npurchased for \ncancellation \n[C]Weighted\naverage\nprice\u00a0($)[D]Number\npurchased\nfor employee\nshare plansWeighted\naverage\nprice\u00a0($)[D]\nJanuary  \u2014  3,902,011  28.34  \u2014  24,834,916 28.82  808,490 55.87\nFebruary  \u2014  20,898,179  30.14  \u2014  21,394,954 30.10  \u2014  \u2014 \nMarch  \u2014  38,967,828  28.79  \u2014  38,609,399 28.69  43,473  56.24 \nApril  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  16,525,479 30.28  \u2014  \u2014 \nMay  \u2014  30,080,360  29.77  \u2014  21,885,562 29.44  \u2014  \u2014 \nJune  \u2014  28,936,231  29.51  \u2014  20,935,786 29.08  20,630  59.93 \nJuly  \u2014  10,731,810 29.95  \u2014  26,627,705 29.94  \u2014  \u2014 \nAugust  \u2014  18,948,478 30.66  \u2014  12,520,862 30.25  \u2014  \u2014 \nSeptember  \u2014  11,763,447 32.11  \u2014  7,852,588 25.70  533,346  64.88 \nOctober  739,283  14,221,426  32.93  217,618  25,366,076  32.40  1,440,509  66.02 \nNovember  5,906,655  20,450,532  32.95  1,703,851  20,831,873  32.47  1,558,442  65.97 \nDecember  4,803,972  22,460,338  32.47  967,773  21,415,661  31.94  1,118,693  64.60 \nTotal 2023  11,449,910  221,360,640  30.66  2,889,242  258,800,861  30.27  5,523,583  64.02 \nJanuary  3,187,890  2,992,417  32.32  1,189,886  20,282,994  31.54  650,966  66.03 \nTotal 2024  3,187,890  2,992,417  32.32  1,189,886  20,282,994  31.54  650,966  66.03 \n[A]Reported as at transaction date.\n[B]American Depositary Shares. \n[C]Under the share buyback programme. \n[D]Includes stamp duty and brokers' commission.\nFinancial information relating to the Royal Dutch Shell \nDividend Access TrustThe results of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust (the Trust) are included in the consolidated results of operations and financial position of Shell. Certain condensed financial information in respect of\u00a0the Trust is given below.\nThe Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited and BG Group \nLimited have each issued a dividend access share to Computershare \nTrustees (Jersey) Limited (the Trustee).  For the years 2023, 2022 \nand\u00a02021, the Trust recorded income before tax of \u00a3nil, \u00a3nil, and \n\u00a32.2\u00a0billion respectively. In each period, this reflected the amount \nof\u00a0dividends payable on the dividend access shares. Dividends \nare\u00a0also\u00a0classified as unclaimed where amounts have not cleared \nrecipient bank accounts.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Trust had total equity of \u00a3nil (December 31, \n2022: \u00a3nil; December 31, 2021: \u00a3nil), reflecting assets of \u00a34 million \n(December 31, 2022: \u00a36 million; December 31, 2021: \u00a37 million) and \nunclaimed dividends of \u00a34 million (December 31, 2022: \u00a36 million; \nDecember 31, 2021: \u00a37 million). The Trust only records a liability for \nan\u00a0unclaimed dividend to the extent that dividend cheque payments \nhave not been presented within 12 months, have expired or have \nbeen\u00a0returned unpresented. As these unclaimed dividends relate to \ndividends that were announced by the Company during the period the \nCompany was still named Royal Dutch Shell plc, and it is expected that \nthe Company will not announce any further dividends on the dividend \naccess shares,  the Trust continues to be named t he Royal Dutch Shell \nDividend Access Trust.  On January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through \nassimilation of each A share and each B share into one ordinary share \nof the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or \ndividend entitlements. Dutch withholding tax, applied previously on \ndividends on A shares, no longer applies on dividends paid on the \nordinary shares following the assimilation.\nIn relation to the assimilation of the Company's A and B shares, the \nTrust will continue in existence for the foreseeable future to facilitate \nthe\u00a0payment of unclaimed dividend liabilities for shareholders of the \nformer B shares until these are either claimed or forfeited in line with \nthe\u00a0terms outlined.  Dividends which are unclaimed after six years will \nbe forfeited and unconditionally revert to The Shell Transport and \nTrading Company Limited and BG Group Limited, as appropriate.Strategic Report | Performance in the year\nGenerating shareholder value | Financial framework continued\n37 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n 37\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2023Market overview\nShell maintains a large business portfolio across an integrated value \nchain and is exposed to fluctuating prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil\u00a0products, chemicals and power.\nSee \"Risk factors\" on page 14. \nThis\u00a0diversified portfolio provides resilience when prices are volatile. Our annual planning cycle and periodic portfolio reviews aim to ensure\u00a0that our levels of capital investment and operating expenses are\u00a0appropriate in the context of a volatile price environment. \nWe prepare annual strategic and financial plans that test different \nscenarios and their impact on prices, our businesses and organisation. We test the resilience of our projects and other opportunities against a\u00a0range of prices for crude oil, natural gas, oil products, chemicals and\u00a0power. Through this process, we identify potential interventions that we believe can drive value, p reserve cash levels and maintain a \nstrong balance sheet. This provides us with resilience against weak market prices.\nThe range of commodity prices and margins used in our project and \nportfolio evaluations is subject to a rigorous assessment of short-, medium- and long-term market drivers. These drivers include the extent\u00a0and pace of the energy transition.\nPhoto: Shell staff working on the trading floor at Shell Centre, London.\nGlobal economic growthAfter a strong economic recovery from the lows of the COVID-19 pandemic , growth in 2023 was more moderate. Several forces are \nholding global economic growth back.  These include the Russia-\nUkraine  war and international trade restrictions. Others are more \ncyclical and include the effects of sharp interest rate increases and liquidity withdrawals by central banks intended to rein in inflation. Rising public debt is also resulting in governments withdrawing the fiscal support they extended during the pandemic. \nThe latest World Economic Outlook, published by the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) in January 2024, estimated global economic growth from 2022 to 2023 to be  3.1%, down from 3.5% in 2022 and \n6.3% in 2021. Advanced economies continue to drive the decline in global growth, with weaker manufacturing offsetting stronger services activity. The slowdown was pronounced in Europe, while the USA remained relatively resilient. Developing economies, on average, have\u00a0experienced stable growth over 2022-2023, although with sizeable shifts across regions . China experienced relatively strong \ngrowth, despite headwinds from its real estate crisis and weak consumer confidence. Looking to 2024, the IMF's  projections for the global economy are \nconsistent with a soft landing, with inflation declining and growth holding up despite the rise in interest rates. But there are several downside risks to the outlook. These include: volatile commodity prices amid geopolitical and climate change risks; and upward surprises in inflation and a corresponding tightening of financial conditions and fiscal consolidation that could weigh on growth. The IMF projects global growth to be around 3% over the m edium term (2024-2028) \u2014 \nbelow the historical average of 3.8% over the past two decades. In the \ncontext of geopolitical risks, this is in an environment where interest rates are expected to be higher for longer.\nGlobal prices, demand and supply\nThe following table provides an overview of the main crude oil and\u00a0natural gas price markers to which Shell is exposed:\nOil and gas average industry prices [A]\n2023 2022 2021\nBrent ($/b)  83  101  71 \nWest Texas Intermediate ($/b)  78  95  68 \nHenry Hub ($/MMBtu)  2.5  6.4  4.0 \nEU TTF ($/MMBtu)  13  40  16 \nJapan Customs-cleared Crude ($/b) - 3 months  89  98  60 \n[A]Yearly average prices are based on monthly average spot prices. The 2023 average price \nfor Japan Customs-cleared Crude is based on available market information up to the end of the period.\nCrude oil and oil products \nThe global benchmark oil price Brent averaged about $83 per \nbarrel\u00a0(bbl)  in 2023, down from $101/bbl in 2022. This reflected \na\u00a0normalisation of\u00a0the market from the period of significant volatility in\u00a02022. As trade flows adjust ed after the disruption caused by the \nRussian invasion of Ukrai ne and more supply became available, \nsupply\u00a0security co ncerns have eased and the market balance \nloosened\u00a0in\u00a02023. \nGlobal demand continued to recover in 2023, at a similar pace \nto\u00a02022. Incremental demand has amounted to around 2.3 million barrels per day (mb/d), of which 1.7 mb/d came from China, where demand rebounded after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. However, demand growth in OECD markets, particularly OECD Europe, has moderated significantly because of slower economic\u00a0growth. \nGlobal supply increased by around 1.9 mb/d in 2023, slightly slower \nthan demand growth. Most of the non-OPEC growth has come from the USA and Brazil, which accounted for around 1.5 mb/d and 0.4 mb/d, \nrespectively. Iran, which is exempt from the OPEC production cut, has also markedly ramped up supply. To balance the market, OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, implemented a series of moves to limit the\u00a0supply available to the market.  In April  2023, OPEC+ announced \na\u00a01.66 mb/d voluntary production cut. This was followed by an additional 1 mb/d voluntary cut by Saudi Arabia from May, which was\u00a0eventually extended through to the first quarter of 2024, with possibility for a further extension. Russia also announced a production cut of 500 thousand barrels a day ( kb/d) for March through to the end \nof 2023 , in addition to a 300 kb/d exports reduction from September \nto the end of the year. The actual crude output from Saudi Arabia and Russia dropped by around 1 mb/d and 0.2 mb/ d, respectively in 2023 \ncompared with 2022, based on the IEA estimate.Strategic Report | Performance in the year\nGenerating shareholder value\n38 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n 38\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2023In 2024, the expected economic slowdown and potential supply \ndisruptions caused by geopolitical tensions  could impact demand. \nMacroeconomic risks and demand concerns had already started \nweighing on the market from the fourth quarter, with Brent dropping by\u00a0$16/bbl by the end of 2023 from the year's peak. The instability in \nthe Middle East remains a significant risk factor. As of now, conflicts in the vicinity of key oil trade routes, such as the Red Sea, have not yet \ncaused severe disruption to supplies. But the risk of disruption could increase if the Israel-Hamas war escalates into a regional conflict.\nNatural gas\nGas market Weak demand, combined with high inventories, has put downward pressure on natural gas prices in key markets in 2023. Although prices were lower than 2022 levels, they remained elevated versus historical levels and continued to show strong volatility. \nTitle Transfer Facility (TTF): In Europe, TTF spot prices averaged\n$13.15/MMBtu (62% lower year-on-year). Strong LNG imports and\u00a0weak regional demand enabled European inventories to \nreach\u00a0110\u00a0billion cubic metres (bcm ), almost 100% full at the end \nof\u00a0October. By year-end, inventories fell to 95 bcm (86%), which is\u00a0still\u00a0a\u00a0comfortable level for that time of the year. Despite storages at\u00a0multi-year highs, supply-side risks in the Middle E ast, and  the threat \nof\u00a0renewed industrial action in Australia, increased price volatility in \nOctober, with spot TTF prices surging to $17.0/MMBtu by the middle of the month, a 40% increase from the start of the month. By year-end, prices retreated to $12.66/MMBtu as Egyptian exports and Israeli pipeline flows resumed and inventories remained elevated. \nJapan Korea Marker (JKM): Spot LNG prices in Asia followed a similar \ntrajectory as in Europe, averaging $14.03/MMBtu (48% lower year-on-year). LNG demand in China remain ed subdued in 2023, relative to \nprevious years. The return of incremental nuclear capacity in Japan has \nkept inventories at elevated levels through much of the year, capping the upside in prices.\nHenry Hub: Henry Hub gas benchmark prices in North America had \na\u00a0less volatile year compared with 2022. Spot prices ranged from $1.77/MMBtu to $3.77/MMBtu with an average of $2.54/MMBtu. The lower volatility was attributable t o a warm first quarter, cool \nsecond quarter, stronger-than-expected dry gas production, an \nincrease in LNG facility maintenance and a continued storage surplus. Temperatures in the first quarter averaged near three degrees warmer \nthan normal. Temperatures in the second quarter averaged one degree cooler than normal. Winter 2023-2024 has been considerably warmer than the 10-year normal. In 2023, natural gas dry\u00a0production averaged 101.45 billion cubic feet a day (bcf/d ) or 4.37 bcf/d above 2022. In \nthe summer of 2023, natural gas storage in the 48 lower states of the USA a veraged 467 bcf higher than in the summer of 2022.\nThe market is expected to remain loose through the remainder of the 2023-2024 winter as production slowly increases and LNG export facilities undergo maintenance. The bearish sentiment is expected to continue into the summer of 2024, which is reflected by the softness of\u00a0the prices seen in summer futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). PowerUnited States: US power prices were largely lower across all major markets in 2023 compared with 2022. One of the key drivers for the\u00a0overall lower power prices and volatility in 2023 was the decline in\u00a0gas prices . After a volatile 2022 , where prices ranged from below \n$4/MMBtu to nearly $10/MMBtu, Henry Hub , the benchmark gas \nprice in\u00a0North America,  stayed mostly below $3/MMBtu for most of \n2023. Power price volatilities  were largely driven by weather events \nthroughout the year and across the country. For the western part of the\u00a0USA, colder than normal temperatures  that started in December \n2022 lingered through March, resulting in strong prices in Mid-C (Mid-Columbia) ($108/MWh) and CAISO (California) ($92/MWh) in the first quarter of 2023. For the eastern part of the USA, a combination of\u00a0a warm winter and mild summer brought stable prices across the PJM and MISO ( Midcontinent ) markets. For Texas, record-breaking \nsummer temperatures resulted in strong price performance. ERCOT (Texas) market prices spiked over $5,000/MWh in June, August and\u00a0September, with On-Peak prices averaging $282/MWh for August\u00a0and $121/MWh for September.\nEurope: European power prices came down from the record levels \nin\u00a02022, but were still elevated. In Germany, for example, the average power price in 2023 was around $103/MWh, down from an average price of $248/MWh in 2022. German power prices were still \nsignificantly higher than the average price of $38/MWh in the period \n2015-2019. Power prices are primarily driven by natural gas prices, which were lower in 2023 than in 2022, but still more than double the \naverage of around $5.6/MMBtu between  2015 and 2019 . In addition, \nthe availability of both hydropower and French nuclear power plants was markedly better in 2023 than in 2022, resulting in lower power prices. The continued deployment of solar and wind capacity is progressively affecting power system operations, which can be seen\u00a0from the impact of weather on hourly prices.\nAustralia: The power and gas markets in Eastern Australia began 2023 \nwith firm price caps on gas and coal after extreme price volatility in \n2022. This -- combined with lower demand  because of  milder winter \nweather, improved coal generator availability and continued growth in\u00a0renewable generation -- reduced tightness in international markets. Healthy domestic gas storage and stronger winter flows from LNG producers to southern markets moderated gas and power prices as they returned to normal levels. Prices, however, continued to be higher than historical levels. Power prices averaged around A$90/MWh for \n2023 compared with A$190/MWh in 2022 and A$75/MWh in 2021. Gas prices averaged around A$12/GJ  (gigajoule) for 2023 \ncompared with around A$40/GJ in 2022 and A$10/GJ in 2021. There has also been increased intraday volatility, as more renewables and distributed solar have entered the system to replace coal. \nCrude oil and natural gas price assumptions\nOur ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial opportunities depends on the accuracy of our price assumptions. We use a rigorous assessment of short-, medium- and long-term market uncertainties to determine what ranges of future crude oil and natural gas prices to use in project and portfolio evaluations. Market uncertainties include, for example, future economic conditions, geopolitics, actions by major resource holders, production costs, technological progress and the balance of supply and demand.\nSee \"Risk factors\" on page 14 and Note 12 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" \non\u00a0pages 281-283 .Strategic Report | Performance in the year\nGenerating shareholder value | Market overview continued\n39 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n 39\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2023Refining and chemical margins \nIn 2023, gross refining margins continued to be well-supported, albeit at a lower level than the highs seen in 2022. The effect of sanctions on Russian oil products meant that Europe was short of middle distillate, leading to low stocks and very high middle distillate product crack spreads. This was exacerbated by refinery slowdowns during the hot European summer as cooling systems struggled to cope. In addition, there were low US gasoline stocks at the start of the US summer holiday season when demand was rising as many more people were driving . This led to a wider spread between gasoline and crude  in the \nAtlantic basin. In the East, Chinese oil demand growth was capped by the economic slowdown. The low product stocks of gasoline and diesel in the Atlantic basin required product flow from Asia providing margin support for Asian refineries outside of China. But this was dampened by Chinese product export quotas which remained at the same elevated level as in 2022. In 2023, new refinery capacity -- such as the Al Zour \nrefinery, the Beaumont expansion and Oman Duqm refinery -- came on\u00a0line  and increased product supply to the market, keeping margins at \na lower level than in 2022.\nFor 2024, further new refinery capacity, such as that from Dangote \nin\u00a0Nigeria,  is expected to come on line. Meanwhile, demand growth \nis\u00a0expected to slow with China's economic outlook being a key factor. Currently, product stock levels in the Atlantic basin of mogas and \ndiesel\u00a0are at higher levels than a year ago, suggesting lower spread s\u00a0between products and crude oil next yea r.\nChemical cracker margins remained pressured in 2023 because \nof\u00a0global oversupply and weak demand. Slowing global market conditions, and high inflation and interest rates, have impacted end-consumer demand. New capacity growth, primarily in Asia and the USA, led to global oversupply with producers continuing to match demand through lower cracker utilisation. The Russia-Ukraine war \nand\u00a0conflicts in the Middle East have impacted energy prices, \nresulting\u00a0in lower margins.\nThe outlook for petrochemical margins in 2024 and beyond depends on feedstock costs and the balance of supply and demand. Global oversupply is expected to persist through the year with a slow demand recovery. A recovery in demand is needed to absorb excess capacity. The supply of petrochemicals will depend on how new facilities coming on line and plant closures will impact net capacity, with utilisation balancing the system. Product prices will reflect the cost of raw materials, which is closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices.Refining margins\nGlobal indicative refining margin [A]\n$/bbl\n2023 2022 2021\nIndicative refining margin  12.45  18.03  4.79 \n[A]The Indicative refining margin (IRM) is an approximation of Shell's global gross refining \nunit\u00a0margin, calculated using price markers from third-party databases.

L ower levels \nof\u00a0maintenance at Pearl GTL in Qatar, and in Trinidad and Tobago \nalso\u00a0contributed to the higher production levels. These were partly offset by the derecognition of Russia's Sakhalin-related volumes and\u00a0production-sharing contract effects in Egypt and at Pearl GTL. In\u00a02023 and 2022, natural gas and liquids made up 86% and 14% of\u00a0total production, respectively.\nLNG liquefaction and sales volumes\nLNG  liquefaction volumes decreased by 5% compared with the \nprevious year, mainly as a result of the derecognition of Sakhalin-related volumes.\nLNG sales volumes increased primarily because of higher purchases \nfrom third parties  but this was partly offset by the derecognition of \nSakhalin-related volumes.Through our trading organisation, we market and sell a portion of \nour\u00a0share of equity production of LNG together with third-party LNG through our hubs in the UK, the UAE and Singapore . Shell has term \nsales contracts for the majority of our LNG liquefaction and term purchase contracts. We are able to optimise the income we generate from our LNG cargoes through our shipping network, regasification terminals and ability to purchase and deliver LNG spot cargoes from third parties. For example, if one customer does not need a scheduled cargo, we can deliver it to another customer who does need it. Similarly, if a customer needs an additional cargo not available from our production facilities, we contract with third parties to deliver the additional cargo. We conduct paper trades, primarily to manage commodity price risk related to sales and purchase contracts.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a \nmyriad of disruptions around the world for three years; Russia\u2019s invasion \nof Ukraine has increased geopolitical tensions; societies have grown \nmore divided than ever; and central banks, seeking to control inflation, \nhave changed tack in monetary policy. All these changes have created \nuncertainties, shrouding the economic and market outlook. Meanwhile, \nthe effects of climate change are manifesting themselves globally, and the \nworld has no time to lose in cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n In these complex and challenging times, it is even more essential \nthat businesses embrace sustainability. Our long-cherished corporate \nphilosophy, Information Revolution\u2014Happiness for everyone, is \nsynonymous with a commitment to sustainability and delivering \nsustainable growth to all our stakeholders.\n For us, fiscal 2022 was another year of sustainability action.\n Among other things, as a strategic investment holding company, we \naddress sustainability challenges together with our investees and subsidiaries.
