And  \nthey do this all with a grounding in both knowing  \ntheir communities and being good neighbors.  \nA little more than a year ago, I said that we  \nwere witnessing the beginning of the next great \nchapter at McDonald\u2019s. There has never been  \na better time to be part of Brand McDonald\u2019s than \nright now\u2014and this past year showed what makes \nMcDonald\u2019s unique: the strength of our people, \nthe scale of our supply chain, the agility of our \nSystem, the importance of local owners operating \nin the communities we serve, and the power of the \nMcDonald\u2019s Brand.  \nThe best part of leading McDonald\u2019s is the pride I \nfeel seeing the commitment of our System and the \nleadership of our restaurant managers and crews. \nThey take our strategy of Accelerating the Arches  \nDear Shareholders, \nthe Global McFamily, \nand our Customers,Annual Letter to Shareholders\nAlways guided by our purpose  \nto feed and foster communities \nMcDonald\u2019s is part of the cultural fabric in \ncommunities around the world. That\u2019s why it  \nis important that  Accelerating the Arches  is a  \nholistic strategy, integrating our business objectives \nand our responsibility to meet society\u2019s evolving \nexpectations of modern businesses to make a \ndifference in the world. It is clear that this will be ever \nmore important in 2022, as we continue to support \ncommunities through the multitude of challenges \nthey face\u2014whether the ongoing impacts of COVID-19  \nor the rapidly changing and devastating humanitarian \ncrisis in Ukraine and throughout Europe.1  Consists of both Company and franchise sales  \n2  Consists of both Company and franchise salesWe continued to meaningfully advance efforts  \nthat focused on our broader role in communities. \nThis includes our commitment to achieving net \nzero emissions across our global operations by \n2050, our progress to create more sustainable \nHappy Meal toys by the end of 2025, our $5 million \ncommitment with the NextGen Consortium  \nto accelerate and scale sustainable packaging,  \nand our commitment to increasing spend  \nwith diverse-owned media partners in the  \nU.S. to help dismantle growth barriers  \nfor diverse-owned companies.  \nAnd through the newly established McDonald\u2019s \nCommunity Fund, the Company is better prepared \nthan ever to respond when people need us  \nmost\u2014whether by investing in Chicago-based \nneighborhood organizations that are actively \nand effectively working to address the youth \nopportunity crisis in our hometown, or a  \ncorporate contribution of $5 million to an  \nemployee assistance fund to support our  \nUkrainian colleagues through the ongoing crisis.A banner year because of the  \nunparalleled strengths of the  \nMcDonald\u2019s System \nOur significant progress\u2014despite continued  \nchallenges like none of us have experienced in  \nour lifetimes\u2014is remarkable. In 2021, we achieved  \nrecord global Systemwide sales1 of $112 billion, \nwith revenues of $23.2 billion. We reported annual \ncomparable sales growth in the U.S. of 13.8%, which \nrepresents over $5 billion of Systemwide sales2  \ngrowth. We delivered record operating income of  \nmore than $10 billion. And Franchisee cash flows hit  \nall-time highs in most of our top markets, including  \nthe U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and Japan.  \nMcDonald\u2019s and our Franchisees are not only  \nwell positioned to withstand the ongoing global  \npressures, but we are set up for the long-term.  \nWhen times are at their darkest, again and again, \nwe see the Golden Arches shine their brightest. And \nwhile what happens next in Ukraine is unclear, we will \ncontinue to support our McFamily and communities \nin Ukraine for as long as is needed.Annual Letter to Shareholders\nWhen times are \nat their darkest, \nagain and again, \nwe see the Golden \nArches shine their \nbrightest. Standards to strengthen our commitment \nto fostering safe, respectful and inclusive \nworkplaces; our Mutual Commitment to Diversity, \nEquity and Inclusion alongside our suppliers to \nsupport diverse-owned businesses; reaching \nglobal gender pay parity; and raising wages at U.S. \ncompany-owned restaurants. Supporting restaurant teams  \nthrough a culture of care \n2021 was a reminder that people remain central  \nto everything we do and everything we seek to  \nachieve. When it comes to being a people  \nbusiness, we will, as Fred Turner said, \u201cnever  \nforget it.\u201d At every location, through even the most \ndifficult moments, our crews have stayed strong, \nkeeping our restaurants running while providing \nhope, inspiration and extraordinary service to our \ncustomers and our communities.  \nWe are proud to offer programs and resources  \nthat support our people, both at work and at  \nhome. Over the past two years, this has  \nincluded simplifying our menu to improve the  \ncrew experience, implementing COVID-19  \nsafety measures to protect the wellbeing of  \ncrew members, enhancing parental leave for  \nU.S. McOpCo management, and modernizing  \nour employee value proposition.

Last year, I was \nproud to announce McDonald\u2019s first ever Chief \nCustomer Officer\u2014Manu Steijaert\u2014to lead the \nnewly created Customer Experience T eam, which \nwill ensure we stay focused on creating frictionless \nexperiences that are seamless and memorable.  \nManu\u2019s appointment was complemented by \nadditional leadership moves, including Paul Pomroy \nas Corporate Senior Vice President, International \nOperated Markets; and Morgan Flatley as Global  \nChief Marketing Officer. We were also excited to \nappoint Desiree Ralls-Morrison as our new General \nCounsel and Corporate Secretary.  \nI am honored to surround myself with a leadership \nteam that elevates and expands our collective \nthinking, and delivers results that propel our  \nbrand forward.  Our focus on the M-C-Ds has driven broad-based  \ngrowth in 2021. Our digital engine continues to  \nmake the customer experience more seamless  \nand fuels growth in the process. In our top six \nmarkets, more than a quarter of Systemwide  \nsales, or $18 billion, came from digital channels  \nin 2021\u2014a 60% increase over 2020. Three of  \nour largest markets  \u2014the U.S., Germany and  \nCanada\u2014all launched loyalty programs in 2021.  \nWith loyalty programs now in more than 40 markets, \nMyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards has exceeded expectations \nin terms of enrollment and participation. After \njust six months in the U.S., there are more than 30 \nmillion loyalty members enrolled and more than \n21 million active members earning rewards. We \nalso announced new long-term global strategic \npartnerships to support McDelivery.  \nWhile we expect that 2022 will be a year of  \ncontinued progress, we also anticipate that many  \nof the challenges we experienced in 2021 will endure. \nFocusing on our foundational operations, expanding \nour growing digital advantages, and continuing to \nput the health and safety of our customers and crew \nfirst will remain critical to executing on Accelerating \nthe Arches.  These accomplishments highlight the \npower of our System when we come together across \nfunctions and geographies, and quickly follow our \ncustomers\u2019 lead. \nChris Kempczinski \nPresident and CEO \nMcDonald\u2019s CorporationA stronger Brand than ever before in person after so long, we asked ourselves, as we \nhave done throughout our history, how we ensure \nthe Brand stays relevant. The answer lies in the \nfounding principles of our model: building a  \nbusiness representative of our customers and \ncommunities, where equity of opportunity is \ncentral to our business. That\u2019s why, late last year, \nwe announced a new Franchisee recruitment \ninitiative to increase the number of Franchisees \nfrom all backgrounds, including historically \nunderrepresented groups, in McDonald\u2019s U.S. and  \nall McDonald\u2019s International Operated Markets.  \nThis includes a $250 million commitment in the U.S. \nover five years to provide alternatives to traditional \nfinancing to help candidates join the McDonald\u2019s \nSystem. During a period of record performance, we \nmust challenge ourselves\u2014even more\u2014to invest in \nthe future. We owe that to our communities\u2014and to \nthe people who make up the McDonald\u2019s System.\nThe enduring strength of McDonald\u2019s Brand gives  \nus confidence that our strategy will continue to \ndeliver sustained, long-term profitable growth  \nfor our System and shareholders. The McDonald\u2019s \nBoard of Directors has provided counsel and an \nunwavering dedication to ensure that in pursuit \nof this objective, we continue to represent all \nstakeholders. I want to thank them, our System,  \nour shareholders, and our customers for their \ncontinued support.  \nAdditionally, I would like to thank the McDonald\u2019s \nBoard of Directors who have provided counsel  \nand an unwavering dedication to represent  \nall stakeholders.\nAnd most importantly, on behalf of the McDonald\u2019s \nSystem, I extend our heartfelt gratitude to our crew. Ray Kroc built McDonald\u2019s as the most independent \nand interdependent Brand on the planet. We see  \nthe power and collaborative spirit of our Brand  \nevery single day\u2014and together, as a System, we  \nwill continue to bring Ray\u2019s vision for collaboration  \nto life, while providing customers the food they \ncrave, experiences they treasure, and the Brand \nthey love. It\u2019s this commitment that will  accelerate \nthe arches  while helping us feed and foster \ncommunities, everywhere. \nEarlier in April and for the first time in four years, \nwe came together as a System at our Worldwide \nConvention. Amid the excitement of being together Annual Letter to Shareholders\n        \n        ## The content of the annual finatial report 2 is in below:\n        Annual ReportWe Are Stronger Than EverDear  \nShareholders, \nthe Global  \nMcFamily and \nour Customers,\nI opened last year\u2019s letter  by stating that \nthere was never a better time to be part of \nBrand McDonald\u2019s. Thanks to the System\u2019s \nhard work, that remains true today.\nDespite facing external pressures in markets \naround the globe in 2022, we continue to \nbuild strong momentum in the business \n\u2013 a true testament to the ingenuity of our \npeople, the resilience of our supply chain \nand the dedication of local franchisees and \nrestaurant teams serving our customers.\nIt was incredibly energizing to bring our \nSystem together last April for our first \nWorldwide Convention since the start of  \nthe pandemic. On full display was what I  \nlove most about McDonald\u2019s \u2013 our restless \nenergy and ambition. We\u2019re never satisfied, \nwhich is why McDonald\u2019s continues to be \none of the world\u2019s leading corporations after \nalmost 70 years. As Ray Kroc used to say, \n\u201cyou\u2019re either green and growing or you\u2019re \nripe and rotting.\u201d In other words, we\u2019re only \ngoing to stay relevant to customers if we\u2019re \nconsistently raising the bar.\nOur Brand is more relevant than ever before, \nbut we still have so much more we can do. \nI\u2019m proud that as we operate from a position \nof strength, we are all pushing ourselves  \nAnnual Letter to Shareholderspopular, we also launched our largest global  \ncampaign ever for the FIFA World Cup,  \u201cWanna  \ngo to McDonald\u2019s?\u201d\nWe are also capitalizing on the strength of the  \n\u2018billion-dollar brand equities\u2019 in our Core  (\u201cC\u201d)   \nmenu \u2013 10 in total \u2013 and growing market share  \nin chicken and beef.  \nMoreover, Digital, Delivery and Drive Thru  (3-\u201cDs\u201d) \ncontinue to demonstrate huge growth potential.  \nWe remain focused on meeting customers where  \nthey are and providing more personalized \nexperiences. We now have almost 50 million  \nactive loyalty users in our top six markets.\nto make the right moves to meet the needs of our \ncommunities and ensure enduring, profitable growth \nfor all stakeholders.\nGrowing market share through \ncustomer centricity  \nThe System\u2019s alignment around our Accelerating the \nArches  growth strategy, which we put in place at the \nstart of the pandemic, has put us in an advantageous \nposition. We are growing market share in most of our \nmarkets; the Brand is more relevant to customers \nand stakeholders than it has been in years; and, since \n2020, we\u2019ve achieved an increase in Systemwide \nsales 1  of nearly $20 billion.  \nThat momentum continued through 2022, as global \ncomparable sales grew by almost 11% \u2013 and global \nguest counts grew by 5%. Our success is a direct \nresult of our continued focus on our M, C, D  \ngrowth pillars:\nWe continue to elevate our Marketing (\u201cM\u201d) through \ncreative excellence and by driving programs with \ncultural relevance that can be scaled across markets. \nNot only do our Famous Orders remain hugelyAccelerating the \nArches has put us in an \nadvantageous position\nEarning the right to meet customer \nneeds in new ways  \nIt\u2019s clear that our business plan is working. However, \nas we have throughout our history, we continue  \nto push ourselves to keep our Brand relevant for \nfuture generations. \nWe asked ourselves two questions: Is there \nanything we should add to Accelerating the Arches ? \nAnd is there anything that could get in the way of its \ncontinued success?  \nAnnual Letter to Shareholders1 Consists of both Company and franchised sales\nThe answer to these two questions led us to evolve \nour Accelerating the Arches  strategy to set up a \nstrong foundation for future growth. We\u2019ll continue \nto double down on our M, C, D growth pillars, while \naccelerating the pace of new restaurant openings \nwhere there is increased customer demand, alongside \na diverse base of franchisees to run them. Additionally, \nwe\u2019re implementing Accelerating the Organization to \nmodernize the way we work as a company so that \nwe\u2019re faster, more innovative and more efficient.\nT o drive these critical elements of our evolved \nstrategy, we have created new leadership roles on  \nour global Senior Leadership T eam and appointed \nvalues-based leaders into new roles.  \nMorgan Flatley has been promoted to Executive \nVice President, Global Chief Marketing Officer and \nNew Business Ventures, where she will continue to \noversee our award-winning marketing efforts and \nexpand her scope to lead new business ventures with \nopportunities that extend the reach of the Brand in \nnew ways.  \nSkye Anderson has been elevated to President,  \nGlobal Business Services (GBS). Skye will oversee GBS,  \na new business unit of McDonald\u2019s that will make the \norganization more efficient, make it easier for teams \nto collaborate and free up time for our markets to \nfocus on driving growth in the business.   \nThese appointments were complemented by \nadditional leadership moves: Kevin Ozan to Senior \nExecutive Vice President, Strategic Initiatives; Ian Borden to Executive Vice President, Chief \nFinancial Officer; Marion Gross to Executive Vice \nPresident, Global Chief Supply Chain Officer; and Jo \nSempels to President, International Developmental \nLicensed Markets. \nIn addition to these moves, we were delighted \nfor Jill McDonald to rejoin McDonald\u2019s last year \nas President, International Operated Markets. \nAnd we also welcomed Brian Rice as our new \nExecutive Vice President, Global Chief Information \nOfficer, and Jon Banner as our new Executive Vice \nPresident, Global Chief Impact Officer.\nI am proud to work closely with such a dynamic \nteam that collectively acts as a phenomenal \nsteward of the Brand. Every single leader embodies \nour values and plays a crucial role in driving efforts \nthat propel our growth.   \nTaking meaningful action to advance  \nequity of opportunity  \nBeyond meeting the changing needs of our \ncustomers, Accelerating the Arches  is guiding  \nour efforts to feed and foster communities and \nmake the Golden Arches shine for more people.  \nAs a first job for thousands and a first opportunity \nfor many entrepreneurs to run their own \nbusinesses, we feel a special responsibility to  \noffer even more meaningful opportunities.  \nMeeting customers \nwhere they are\nAnnual Letter to Shareholderschanges. And it\u2019s more important than ever that  \nwe raise our ambition to meet tomorrow\u2019s \nchallenges and make the important decisions  \nthat go with them.\nAs we closed out 2022 and hit the ground running \nin 2023, we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to \nlook forward to \u2013 not just in the year ahead, but in \nthis next great chapter at McDonald\u2019s. Throughout \nthis chapter and beyond, I am confident that we will \ncontinue to deliver sustained, long-term, profitable \ngrowth for our System and shareholders.\nThank you to our shareholders and valued \ncustomers for your continued support; thank you to \nour Board of Directors for their ongoing guidance \nand support; and thank you to the McDonald\u2019s \nSystem for making this another year of which I am \nimmensely proud. In the last year, this included advancing education \nand skill development opportunities. We awarded \nmore than $20 million in tuition assistance, and \naccess to education for more than 10,000 employees \nthrough our Archways to Opportunity  program. \nAdditionally, we launched support for 40 non-\nprofits that provide pre-employment support and \nskills development primarily to Black and Latinx \ncommunities through the new Chicago Community \nImpact Grants  program.\nKey to building a talent pipeline of future leaders \nand expanding opportunity is fostering a culture of \ninclusivity.

Mackenzie \nChairMy geologist's mind has always been intrigued by what lies beneath \nour\u00a0feet, including the natural energy resources that have propelled the\u00a0world's economic progress for so long. But with the  urgent  need \nto\u00a0tackle climate change, I am just as fascinated by the technologies that will help the world deliver cleaner power and fuel the future, as\u00a0well as\u00a0significantly cut carbon emissions.\nAlong with great challenges, the energy transition offers tremendous \nopportunities to those eager to play their part. For well over a century, Shell has pioneered ways of providing energy to people. We are a\u00a0leader in deep-water oil production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) \nand\u00a0biofuels, and we aim to become one of the largest p roviders \nof\u00a0charging for electric vehicles. \nWe aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive \nstrengths and see strong customer demand and clear support from governments. Our strategy is to create value for our shareholders, customers and wider society as we reduce our emissions and fulfil our\u00a0purpose to provide more and cleaner energy solutions.\nFor Shell, 2023 was a pivotal year in our drive to achieve more value \nwith less emissions. It was the first year under our new Chief Executive Officer, Wael Sawan, who stressed the importance of enhancing our returns to\u00a0shareholders, while staying firm on our target to become a \nnet-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We did exactly that by maintaining a very healthy balance sheet, increasing our dividends and\u00a0continuing to buy back shares, all while investing capital to reduce\u00a0our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and Scope 3 emissions related\u00a0to\u00a0the use of the oil products we sell.\nPeople everywhere need a secure, sustainable and affordable energy \nsupply. Shell can help to enable a balanced energy transition by keeping the world moving with oil and gas, while delivering the low-carbon alternatives our customers need to decarbonise. To this end, we\u00a0have made it clear that we plan to expand our LNG business and develop new low-carbon products and technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). \nI saw this when I visited Qatar's North Field expansion project in \nJanuary 2024. This project will support the delivery of much-needed supplies of natural gas around the world and I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about how we are developing a CCS project\u00a0there. I also visited Oman and saw how we are moving \nforward\u00a0with a\u00a0hydrogen project, enabled by CCS. \nMore value, less emissions\nShell's 2023 earnings were strong and we reduced our total combined Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 31% [A] compared with 2016 levels. This positions us well as we continue \nto implement our strategy , guided by the free cash flow *, investment and \ncost reduction targets set in 2023. We will continue to create value for shareholders and lower emissions .\n[A] Reduc ed from 83 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2016 to 57 million \ntonnes CO2e in 2023\n* Non-GAAP measure (see page 365).Strategic Report\nChair's message\n2 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n 2\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2023Our energy transition update, published on March 14, 2024 , aims \nto\u00a0keep us on track to\u00a0meet our climate targets and ambitions. As \nwe\u00a0continue to supply oil and gas, we\u00a0must continually work to lower carbon emissions from our own operations and offer our customers more low- and zero-carbon fuels to\u00a0meet their needs in a world on \nits\u00a0way to net zero. \nIn November , I saw first-hand how committed our teams are to \ntransforming the refinery in Rheinland, Germany, into an energy and chemicals park . We are building a renewable hydrogen electrolyser \nto\u00a0help decarbonise our own operations and we will convert a hydrocracker into a base oils production unit. The teams have also almost finished building a plant to produce bioLNG for heavy-duty road transport . The use of bioLNG in this slower-to-decarbonise sector \ncould be a game changer for accelerating the energy transition.\nThe energy  transition must be just and fair, and we are committed to \nrespecting nature and powering lives in our activities. The Board visited \nLNG Canada in June, where we are building a major project designed to deliver a secure supply of energy. Our people there have worked closely with indigenous communities to help protect the environment.\nInnovating for net zeroTackling climate change will need new technologies. It will also demand collective action from governments, businesses and consumers, even in the face of heightened instability caused by the Russia-Ukraine \nwar and renewed major conflict in the Middle East.\nInnovation is vital to the energy transition and is close to my heart. In \nSeptember , I met with students in China who had taken part in the Shell \nEco-marathon by embracing the challenge to design and make energy-\nefficient vehicles. Their passion and perseverance should inspire us\u00a0all to keep pushing the boundaries of what is technically possible. \nShell is determined to help tackle climate change. We must do this with \ncontinued innovation and we will lead where we have the expertise and experience . For instance, our Ra\u00edzen biofuels joint venture in Brazil \nand our renewable natural gas acquisition Nature Energy in Denmark, completed in February 2023, help us to be well placed to play an increasing role in\u00a0supplying lower-carbon transport fuels. \nUnder Wael's leadership in 2023, we began streamlining our business , \nset clear targets, tightened up on spending and reduced emissions. \nThe\u00a0energy transition is an evolution that we are proud to be part of.\u00a0We are carefully choosing where we can make the biggest, most\u00a0positive impact as we move forward to becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, purposefully and profitably.\nShell has the drive, the ingenuity and the competitive edge to make \nthings happen: to create value for investors, customers and society, and\u00a0contribute to a low-carbon world.\nSir Andrew Mackenzie \nChairPowering\u00a0Progress\n1.We produced first gas from Oman's Mabrouk North-East field in Block 10 \n(Shell\u00a0interest 53.45%) in 2023. Block 10 is our first operated venture in Oman. \n2.In 2023, in China, we opened our  largest electric vehicle charging station. The charging \nstation is operated by Shell and BYD Electric Vehicle Investment Company Limited. \n3.The Whale platform (Shell interest 60%) was built in Singapore and is expected \nto\u00a0start\u00a0production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2024.Strategic Report\nChair's message continued\n3 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n1.\n2.\n3.\n3\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\u201cWe will deliver more value \nfor\u00a0our shareholders, our \ncustomers and wider society, with less emissions.\u201d\nWael Sawan \nChief Executive OfficerIn 2023, the Russia-Ukraine war continued and renewed conflict in the \nMiddle East raised the spectre of another regional war. Too many lives have been destroyed and I hope for an end to these human tragedies soon. Geopolitical volatility and the fragmentation of our world are growing at a time when we should be working together to fight the global challenge of climate change.\nA balanced energy transition, which Shell supports, is one that \nmaintains secure and affordable energy supplies, while the world builds\u00a0the clean energy system of the future. Billions of people depend on energy and hundreds of millions still hope to have access to it. Energy is\u00a0vital for lives everywhere.\nThe energy system has shown promising signs of progress, despite \ngeopolitical, supply chain and regulatory challenges. Renewable power has seen record growth in recent years and one-fifth of\u00a0all \nnew\u00a0car sales in the world are now electric. In March, I saw the \nresults\u00a0of this growth first-hand on a Shell electric vehicle charging site\u00a0in Beijing serving around 1,000 customers a day.\nAt Shell, we sharpened our Powering Progress strategy in 2023 with\u00a0a\u00a0relentless focus on performance, discipline and simplification as\u00a0we\u00a0move towards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We will deliver more value for our shareholders, our customers and wider society, with less emissions. At Capital Markets Day in June, we showed how we plan to\u00a0profitably transform Shell through the strength of our portfolio, our\u00a0technological and trading capabilities, and our deep customer relationships. We will be guided by the financial and climate targets and ambitions we have set.\nPerformance and discipline\nIt was another strong year for Shell. One highlight for me was QGC in\u00a0Australia, which had its highest ever liquefied natural gas (LNG) production in the fourth quarter and delivered its 1,000\nth LNG cargo. \nAnother was the strong operational performance in our deep-water portfolio. Completing the acquisition of Nature Energy, which expanded the range of low-carbon energy we can offer, also stood out.\nCash flow from operations for 2023 of around $54 billion was the \nsecond-highest in our history, income was around $20 billion and \nAdjusted Earnings * around $28 billion. Our\u00a0performance enabled \nus\u00a0to return $23 billion to shareholders* through $15 billion in share buybacks and $8 billion in dividends.  This is 42%* of cash flow from \noperations (CFFO) and around the upper end of our 30-40% of CFFO through the cycle target  range.\nWe continue to be disciplined in our investments, focusing on where we\u00a0can have the maximum impact in generating value or lowering emissions. In 2023, cash capital expenditure* of  $24 billion was \nat\u00a0the\u00a0lower end of our $23-27\u00a0billion range.\n* Non-GAAP measure (see page 365).Strategic Report\nChief Executive\nOfficer's review\n4 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n 4\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2023Between 2023 and 2025 , we plan to invest around $40 billion in \noil\u00a0and gas. An example of more value with less emissions is the Vito \nplatform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico, which started production in 2023. Vito cost less to build because its topsides and hull are a third of the size of its original design and is expected to produce around 80% less emissions over its operating life. We are using the \nsame concept for two more platforms: Whale (Shell interest 60%) and\u00a0Sparta (Shell interest 51%).\nSimplification\nFrom July 1, 2023, our smaller Executive Committee took effect with two clear business directorates , and a single finance, strategy, mergers and \nacquisitions and sustainability directorate. This simplification has already enabled more streamlined planning and improved decision-making. We are also in the process of moving to our new Safety, Environment & Asset Management Standards (SEAM), which will reduce the number of key requirements to around 500 from the current 1,800 and enable our people to focus on implementing our strategy more efficiently.\nBy the end of 2023, we had achieved around $1 billion of structural \ncost reductions*, positioning us well to save  the $2-3 billion we said \nwe\u00a0would by the end of 2025. Less emissions\nI am proud that by the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60%\u00a0of our target to halve emissions in our own operations by 2030, \ncompared with 2016  levels on a net basis. We will work to continue \nreducing emissions from our own operations, including by powering oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. In August, our unmanned solar- and wind-powered platform in the Timi gas field (Shell interest 75%) delivered first gas and we will continue to explore this concept.\nIn support of a balanced energy transition, between 2023 and 2025, \nwe will invest  around $35 billion in Downstream and Renewables and \nEnergy Solutions . In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon \nenergy, including the acquisition of Nature Energy  and in the \nCrossWind joint venture off the Dutch coast, which will supply renewable power to the Holland Hydrogen 1 electrolyser.  In China, we \nopened our largest electric vehicle charging  station, while globally we \ncontinued to transform our refineries into energy and chemicals parks. \nOur strategy confirms our commitment to Integrated Gas, particularly \nLNG where we are growing our portfolio even more and will increase capacity by around 11 million tonnes per year in the second half of the decade \u2013 that is an annual increase of more than a quarter of our current capacity. LNG plays a major role as a lower-carbon alternative to coal and as a partner to wind and solar for electricity generation. As\u00a0we increase our LNG activities, we will continue work on reducing our methane emissions to\u00a0near-zero by 2030.\nWe want to remain a leader  in biofuels and as demand for low-carbon \nfuels grows, we expect to sell less oil products. We aim to lead in\u00a0the \nenergy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil\u00a0products \nby\u00a015-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [A]. \nAs we pursue more value with less emissions, we must remain \ndisciplined. For example, last summer we pulled out of a tender for a\u00a0wind farm off the coast of Germany when it did not meet our test for\u00a0capital discipline. \nThe importance of learning\nThe safety of everyone working for Shell is our top priority. I am deeply saddened by the death of five contractor colleagues in incidents that took place at Shell operations in 2023. One contractor in Malaysia and another in the Philippines died while at work. In Nigeria, two contractors were shot, along with four government security agents, in an appalling attack on a convoy. Also in Nigeria, a contractor injured in a tugboat fire late in 2023 died in early 2024. My heart goes out to all the families and friends of those who have died. Our personal safety results fell short of what we achieved in 2022 and we are committed to doing better through learning from these and other incidents. Applying what we have learned in the past has helped us achieve our lowest number of process safety events on record in 2023.\nI visited Oman in June for our Safety Day. This was significant for me \nbecause it is where I started at  Shell 26 years ago. Talking to our \npeople there  brought back many memories \u2013 my passion for the \nbusiness, my hope for the future, but also how much I had to learn. We\u00a0must always be open to new ideas.\nBeing the best we can be\nOur strategy is also about respecting nature and powering lives.  \nWe\u00a0give more detail on how we are progressing in these areas in this Annual Report (on pages 116  and 124) and in our\u00a0Sustainability Report.\nIn 2023, I visited a number of our teams, including in Abu Dhabi , \nBrazil,\u00a0China, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Oman, Qatar and the United States. I never cease to be impressed by the calibre of people I\u00a0meet on these trips. Shell's best asset is its people. Streamlining our \norganisation can harness their creativity by cutting bureaucracy and making processes more efficient. I want our people to focus their energies on making Shell the best it can\u00a0be. \nAt Shell, we are guided by the clarity of our purpose to provide more\u00a0and \ncleaner energy solutions. We focus on what we can control. And, as we embed performance, discipline and simplification into Shell's culture, I\u00a0believe we are the investment case through the energy\u00a0transition. \nWael Sawan\nChief Executive Officer\n* Non-GAAP measure (see page 365).[A]Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were \n517\u00a0million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\n2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e \nin\u00a02021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016.Strategic Report\nChief Executive Officer's review continued\n5 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023\n 5\nShell Annual Report and Accounts 2023Shell is a global group of energy and petrochemical \ncompanies, employing around 103,000 people [A] and\u00a0with\n\u00a0operations in more than 70 countries.\nWe seek to provide the world with the energy it needs today, \nwhile helping it build a sustainable energy future. \nOur competitive advantages are built upon our large and \ndiverse\u00a0portfolio, people who have outstanding talent, strong technological capability and deep customer reach, which we are\u00a0leveraging to help enable a balanced energy transition.Shell's stakeholders include our customers, investors, employees and contractors, pensioners, our strategic partners and suppliers, the communities where we work, civil society, academia and think tanks, governments and regulators.\nWe expect our employees and contractors to maintain our focus on \nsafety and abide by our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people.\n[A]At December 31, 2023. \nOur operating businesses\nIntegrated Gas and Upstream Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions \nIntegrated Gas and Upstream (IGU) explores for and extracts crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

Our purpose -- to provide more and\u00a0cleaner energy solutions \u2013 drives our strategy. \nOur strategy is built upon: generating shareholder value, achieving net-\nzero emissions, powering lives and respecting nature. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we announced how we will put our strategy into action with a relentless focus on performance, discipline and simplification as we aim to deliver more value with less emissions. \nWe are building on our strengths in Integrated Gas, Upstream and \nMarketing. We will invest around $40 billion in leading Integrated Gas\u00a0and advantaged Upstream assets over 2023-2025. This will help drive significant and resilient cash delivery, while helping to provide energy security. Over the same period, investment in Downstream and\u00a0Renewables and Energy Solutions will be around $35 billion, of\u00a0which $10-15 billion will be in\u00a0low-carbon energy solutions, \nas\u00a0we\u00a0help to enable the energy transition.Achieving net zero\nThe Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response tothe threat of climate change by \"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and\u00a0pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\". Shell supports the Paris Agreement goal to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\u00b0C abovepre-industrial levels. To\u00a0achieve this, urgent action is needed to reduce emissions across all\u00a0sectors.\nWe are working to become a net-zero emissions energy business. \nThis\u00a0means net-zero carbon emissions from our operations. It\u00a0also means net-zero carbon emissions from the energy products we\u00a0sell (including those produced by others), which currently account\u00a0for over 90% of \nthe\u00a0total emissions we report. We\u00a0support a balanced energy transition where the world maintains a\u00a0secure and affordable supply of\u00a0energy, while building the clean energy system of the future. We want to play our part in the energy transition, purposefully and profitably.\nWe aim to partner with our customers, suppliers and governments to \nhelp decarbonise the energy system.
